## Topic 3 — Relative Quantities

*(Linking Ratios and Proportions to Percentages)*

---

### 📘 Explanation:

**What does “relative quantity” mean?**
“Relative” means **in comparison to something else**.
So, a *relative quantity* tells you **how much one amount is compared to another** — like ratio, fraction, or percent.

For example:

* If there are 2 red marbles and 3 blue marbles → red : blue = 2 : 3
* Out of 5 marbles total, 2 are red → red = 2/5 = 40% of total

This idea connects **ratios**, **fractions**, and **percentages** — they all show the *same relationship* in different ways.

---

### ⚖️ Three Ways to Compare Quantities

1. **As a Ratio**

   * Ratio compares two quantities using “:”.
   * Example: 3 red : 2 blue

2. **As a Fraction of the Whole**

   * To find what fraction one part is:
     Fraction = Part ÷ Total
     Example: 3 red, 2 blue → total 5 → red = 3/5 of total.

3. **As a Percentage**

   * Multiply the fraction by 100.
     Percentage = (Part ÷ Total) × 100
     Example: 3 red out of 5 → (3 ÷ 5) × 100 = 60%.

### 🔄 Converting Between Them

| Ratio | Fraction | Percent |
| ----- | -------- | ------- |
| 1 : 4 | 1/5      | 20%     |
| 3 : 2 | 3/5      | 60%     |
| 2 : 3 | 2/5      | 40%     |
| 1 : 1 | 1/2      | 50%     |

**Shortcut to compare quickly:**
If comparing two quantities A and B →
How much bigger or smaller?  A ÷ B  or  B ÷ A

**Example:**
If bag A has 40 sweets and bag B has 50 sweets →
B is 50 ÷ 40 = 1.25 times A → 25% more.

### 🧠 Real-Life Understanding

Think of “relative quantities” as **comparing parts**:

* Comparing boys to girls in a class (ratio).
* Comparing one team’s score to another’s.
* Comparing discount to full price (percent off).

If the whole changes, the percentage/fraction changes — but the ratio between parts can still hold.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                 | Correct Thinking                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Adding ratios directly                  | Convert to actual amounts first.                 |
| Comparing raw numbers without same base | Always relate to same total.                     |
| Confusing part:whole and part:part      | Use total when finding fractions or percentages. |
| Forgetting to simplify ratios           | Always reduce ratios to simplest form.           |

### 🧮 Examples

1️⃣ **Convert ratio to fraction and percent:**
Ratio 2 : 3
→ Total parts = 5
→ Fraction = 2/5
→ Percent = (2 ÷ 5) × 100 = 40%

---

2️⃣ **Compare two ratios:**
Which is a larger red share — 3 : 2 or 4 : 3?

* For 3 : 2 → total 5 → red = 3/5 = 60%
* For 4 : 3 → total 7 → red = 4/7 ≈ 57%
  → 3 : 2 has slightly more red.

---

3️⃣ **Find missing quantity using ratio:**
Ratio boys : girls = 2 : 3, total 30 pupils.
Sum of parts = 5 → one part = 30 ÷ 5 = 6.
→ Boys = 2 × 6 = 12, Girls = 3 × 6 = 18

---

4️⃣ **Find percentage increase (relative comparison):**
A jug holds 2 L, another holds 2.5 L.
(2.5 − 2) ÷ 2 = 0.25 = 25%
→ Second jug is 25% larger.

---

5️⃣ **Compare two quantities directly:**
If Item A costs £80 and Item B costs £100,
then B is 100 ÷ 80 = 1.25 → 25% more expensive.
