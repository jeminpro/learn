# Solving Word Problems Involving Fractions

This topic brings **everything together** — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and interpreting what a fraction means in real life.

It’s not just about numbers; it’s about:

* Understanding what’s being asked
* Choosing the right operation
* Showing your working clearly
* Applying **fraction logic** to **real-life contexts**

### 🧠 Strategy:

1. **Read carefully**: What’s the total? What part?
2. **Underline keywords**: “of”, “left”, “shared”, “each gets”, “more than”, etc.
3. **Choose the right operation**:

   * "Of" → Multiply
   * "Shared between" → Divide
   * "Left over" → Subtract
   * "Together" → Add
4. **Simplify** at the end

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Sam eats 2/5 of a 30cm chocolate bar. How much did he eat?
   → 2/5 × 30 = **12cm**

2. A jug holds 1 litre. You drink 3/4 of it and your friend drinks 1/4. How much is left?
   → 1 − (3/4 + 1/4) = **0L** (none left)

3. A cake is 2/3 kg. You divide it equally between 4 people.
   → 2/3 ÷ 4 = 2/3 × 1/4 = **2/12 = 1/6 kg each**
