# Comparing Fractions

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

When we **compare fractions**, weâ€™re trying to figure out **which is bigger or smaller**.

But here's the tricky part: fractions can look different but still mean the same thing (like 1/2 = 2/4). So, we need to make sure weâ€™re comparing them fairly.

### ðŸ§ƒ Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine two glasses of juice. One has **1/2** of orange juice, another has **3/4**. Which glass has **more juice**?

To compare fairly, we need to look at **equal-sized parts**. This means either:

1. **Make denominators the same**, or
2. **Convert to decimals**, or
3. **Use a visual diagram (like shading rectangles)**

### ðŸ§  Methods to Compare Fractions:

#### âœ… Method 1: Make Denominators the Same

Find a common denominator and rewrite both fractions.

> Compare 2/3 and 3/4
> Common denominator = 12
> â†’ 2/3 = 8/12
> â†’ 3/4 = 9/12
> â†’ 9/12 > 8/12 â†’ So 3/4 > 2/3

#### âœ… Method 2: Cross Multiply

Multiply diagonally (crosswise) and compare.

> 2/3 vs 3/4
> â†’ 2 Ã— 4 = 8
> â†’ 3 Ã— 3 = 9
> â†’ Since 8 < 9 â†’ 2/3 < 3/4

### ðŸ§® Examples:

1. Which is bigger: 1/2 or 3/5?
   â†’ Convert: 1/2 = 5/10, 3/5 = 6/10 â†’ So, 3/5 is bigger

2. Compare: 4/6 and 2/3
   â†’ Simplify: 4/6 = 2/3 â†’ Theyâ€™re equal

3. Which is smaller: 5/8 or 3/4?
   â†’ 5/8 = 10/16, 3/4 = 12/16 â†’ So, 5/8 is smaller

4. Arrange: 1/3, 1/2, 3/4 in order
   â†’ Common denominator = 12
   â†’ 4/12, 6/12, 9/12 â†’ Order = 1/3 < 1/2 < 3/4
