# Rules for Fraction Operations

### 1. ADDITION (+)
**When to use:** Combining or putting together

**Key words:** "altogether," "total," "in all," "combined," "both"

**Example:** Tom ate 1/4 of pizza, Lucy ate 1/3 of pizza = How much pizza eaten **altogether**?
→ **ADD:** 1/4 + 1/3

### 2. SUBTRACTION (-)
**When to use:** Taking away or finding the difference

**Key words:** "left over," "remaining," "more than," "difference," "how much more"

**Example:** Sarah had 3/4 cup flour, used 1/3 cup. How much is **left over**?
→ **SUBTRACT:** 3/4 - 1/3

### 3. MULTIPLICATION (×)
**When to use:** Finding a PART of something

**Key words:** "of," "What fraction of," "Find 2/3 of"

**Example:** Emma ate 1/2 **of** a cake that was 3/4 the normal size.
→ **MULTIPLY:** 1/2 × 3/4

### 4. DIVISION (÷)
**When to use:** Splitting into equal parts or finding HOW MANY

**Key words:** "How many," "divided into," "each piece," "per person"

**Example:** **How many** 1/8 cup servings can you make from 3/4 cup?
→ **DIVIDE:** 3/4 ÷ 1/8

## Super Simple Memory Trick

**"APTM"** - **A**dd **P**ut **T**ake **M**any

- **A**dd = putting together
- **P**art = multiplication (finding part "of")
- **T**ake away = subtraction  
- **M**any = division (how many)

---

## Quick Decision Tree

When you see a fraction word problem, ask:

1. **Am I putting things together?** → **ADD**
2. **Am I taking something away?** → **SUBTRACT**  
3. **Am I finding a part OF something?** → **MULTIPLY**
4. **Am I finding HOW MANY of something?** → **DIVIDE**

---

## Practice This Simple Method:

**Step 1:** Read the problem
**Step 2:** Find the key word (altogether, left over, of, how many)
**Step 3:** Match it to the operation
**Step 4:** Solve

**Example:** "Tom has 2/3 cup of juice. He drinks 1/4 cup. How much is left over?"

- Key word: "**left over**" 
- Operation: **SUBTRACT**
- Answer: 2/3 - 1/4

Try this method and it will become automatic very quickly!

## ANSWERS WITH EXPLANATIONS

### Section A: Fraction Comparison (1-10)

**1. Answer: Tom ate more pizza**
- Sarah: 3/8, Tom: 2/5
- Convert to common denominator: 3/8 = 15/40, 2/5 = 16/40
- Since 16/40 > 15/40, Tom ate more

**2. Answer: No, she does not have enough flour**
- Recipe needs: 2/3 cup, Mary has: 5/8 cup
- Convert to common denominator: 2/3 = 16/24, 5/8 = 15/24
- Since 15/24 < 16/24, she doesn't have enough

**3. Answer: James ran further**
- James: 3/4 mile, Lucy: 7/10 mile
- Convert to common denominator: 3/4 = 15/20, 7/10 = 14/20
- Since 15/20 > 14/20, James ran further

**4. Answer: The first bottle (5/6 litre) contains more water**
- Bottle 1: 5/6, Bottle 2: 4/5
- Convert to common denominator: 5/6 = 25/30, 4/5 = 24/30
- Since 25/30 > 24/30, the first bottle contains more

**5. Answer: Alex completed a greater fraction**
- Emma: 7/12, Alex: 3/5
- Convert to common denominator: 7/12 = 35/60, 3/5 = 36/60
- Since 36/60 > 35/60, Alex completed more

**6. Answer: The first car (3/8 full) has more fuel**
- Car 1: 3/8, Car 2: 2/7
- Convert to common denominator: 3/8 = 21/56, 2/7 = 16/56
- Since 21/56 > 16/56, the first car has more fuel

**7. Answer: Lisa's brother ate more chocolate**
- Lisa: 5/9, Brother: 4/7

- Since 27/90 > 20/90, Pipe A lost more

**9. Answer: Flowers take up more space**
- Vegetables: 7/15, Flowers: 2/5
- Convert to common denominator: 7/15 = 7/15, 2/5 = 6/15
- Since 7/15 > 6/15, vegetables actually take up more space

[Correction: Vegetables take up more space]

**10. Answer: Kate saved a greater fraction**
- David: 4/9, Kate: 3/7
- Convert to common denominator: 4/9 = 28/63, 3/7 = 27/63
