# Rounding Numbers

### 📘 Explanation:

**What does rounding mean?**
Rounding means **simplifying a number** to make it **easier to work with**, while keeping it **close to its original value**.

Imagine rounding as “tidying up” numbers — you’re not changing them completely, just making them neater!

### **Why Do We Round Numbers?**

* To make estimates or mental maths quicker
* To show approximate values (e.g. population ≈ 67 million)
* To express answers to a sensible degree of accuracy (e.g. money to nearest pound)

### **Rounding Rules**

| You are rounding to... | Look at...     | Example          | Rule                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | -------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Nearest 10             | Ones digit     | 34 → 30, 36 → 40 | If the ones digit is **5 or more**, round **up**; if **4 or less**, round **down** |
| Nearest 100            | Tens digit     | 472 → 500        | Tens 7 → round up                                                                  |
| Nearest 1000           | Hundreds digit | 3,450 → 3,000    | Hundreds 4 → round down                                                            |
| 1 Decimal Place        | Next digit     | 3.46 → 3.5       | Next digit 6 → round up                                                            |

### **Step-by-Step Method**

1. **Underline the place you’re rounding to.**
2. **Circle the next digit to the right.**
3. **If it’s 5 or more → add 1** to the underlined digit.
   If it’s 4 or less → keep it the same.
4. **Change all digits after it to zeros (for whole numbers)** or remove them (for decimals).

**Examples of Rounding in Real Life**

* A school has **428 students**, rounded to the nearest 100 → **400**
* The price £7.46, rounded to the nearest 10p → **£7.50**
* A distance of 3,246 m rounded to the nearest 1,000 → **3,000 m**

**Common Mistakes:**

* Rounding **too early** in a multi-step problem
* Forgetting that 5 means *round up*
* Not replacing digits with zeros when rounding whole numbers
