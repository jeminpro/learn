# Negative Numbers

### ðŸ“˜ Explanation:

**What are negative numbers?**
Negative numbers are **numbers less than zero**.
They are used to show things like **temperatures below freezing**, **money owed**, or **heights below sea level**.

Imagine a **thermometer**:

* Above zero â†’ **positive** numbers (e.g. +5Â°C)
* Below zero â†’ **negative** numbers (e.g. âˆ’5Â°C)

So, the further down the thermometer, the smaller the number.

### **Number Line Model**

```
â€¦ âˆ’5  âˆ’4  âˆ’3  âˆ’2  âˆ’1  0  +1  +2  +3  +4  +5 â€¦
```

* Numbers **to the right** are **greater**.
* Numbers **to the left** are **smaller**.
* Zero sits in the **middle** â€” itâ€™s neither positive nor negative.

### **Where We See Negative Numbers in Real Life**

* **Temperatures:**  âˆ’3Â°C means 3Â°C below zero
* **Money:**  âˆ’Â£10 means you owe Â£10
* **Elevations:**  âˆ’50 m means 50 metres below sea level
* **Sports scores:** losing points (e.g. âˆ’2 points)

### **Key Rules**

1. **Comparing:**
   A negative number is **always less than zero**.
   Example: âˆ’2 < 0 < +2

2. **Adding/Subtracting:**

   * Moving **right** on the number line â†’ add
   * Moving **left** â†’ subtract
     Example:  âˆ’3 + 5 = 2

3. **Double Negative:**
   Two negatives make a **positive**.
   Example:  âˆ’(âˆ’4) = +4

---

**Common Mistakes:**

* Thinking âˆ’7 is greater than âˆ’3 because 7 > 3 â†’ actually **âˆ’7 < âˆ’3**.
* Forgetting the direction on the number line (right = bigger, left = smaller).
* Mixing signs when adding/subtracting across zero.
