## 🧮 Topic-by-Topic Shortcuts & Tricks

### 1. **Number & Place Value**

#### 🎯 Quick Wins:
- **Units Digit Check**: When multiplying, check last digits first
  - Example: 67 × 3 must end in 1 (7×3=21) → Eliminate all answers not ending in 1
  
- **Rounding Power**: Round to nearest 10/100 for instant estimation
  - Example: 398 + 204 ≈ 400 + 200 = 600
  - Real answer will be very close (602)

- **Place Value Logic**: 
  - Adding hundreds to thousands won't change the ten-thousands digit
  - Subtracting tens from hundreds won't affect the thousands digit

#### 💡 Extra Tip:
**Number Bonds to 10/100/1000** - Memorise these:
- 7+3, 6+4, 8+2, 9+1 (to 10)
- 73+27, 64+36, 81+19 (to 100)
- Speeds up mental addition massively!

### 2. **Multiplication & Division**

#### 🎯 Instant Divisibility Rules:
| Divide by | Rule | Example |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 2 | Last digit even | 346 ✓ |
| 3 | Sum of digits ÷ 3 | 246: 2+4+6=12 ✓ |
| 4 | Last 2 digits ÷ 4 | 3,528: 28÷4=7 ✓ |
| 5 | Ends in 0 or 5 | 475 ✓ |
| 6 | Divisible by 2 AND 3 | 252 ✓ |
| 8 | Last 3 digits ÷ 8 | 1,024: 024÷8=3 ✓ |
| 9 | Sum of digits ÷ 9 | 738: 7+3+8=18 ✓ |
| 10 | Ends in 0 | 850 ✓ |

#### 🎯 Multiplication Hacks:
- **×5**: Halve then ×10 (46×5 = 23×10 = 230)
- **×9**: ×10 then subtract original (34×9 = 340-34 = 306)
- **×11**: Add digits, put in middle (35×11 = 3_5, 3+5=8 → 385)
- **×15**: ×10 then add half (24×15 = 240+120 = 360)
- **×25**: ÷4 then ×100 (36×25 = 9×100 = 900)

#### 💡 The Doubling & Halving Trick:
- 16 × 25 = 8 × 50 = 4 × 100 = 400
- Keep halving one and doubling the other!

---

### 3. **Fractions**

#### 🎯 Lightning Comparisons:
- **Same denominator**: Bigger numerator wins (3/7 > 2/7)
- **Same numerator**: Smaller denominator wins (3/4 > 3/5)
- **Cross multiply**: 3/5 vs 4/7 → 3×7=21 vs 4×5=20 → 3/5 wins

#### 🎯 Fraction Arithmetic Shortcuts:
- **Adding with same denominator**: Just add tops (2/9 + 4/9 = 6/9 = 2/3)
- **Fraction of a number**: Divide by bottom, multiply by top
  - 3/5 of 45 = (45÷5)×3 = 9×3 = 27

#### 💡 Memory Aid - Common Equivalents:
- 1/2 = 0.5 = 50%
- 1/3 ≈ 0.33 = 33.3%
- 1/4 = 0.25 = 25%
- 1/5 = 0.2 = 20%
- 1/8 = 0.125 = 12.5%
- 3/4 = 0.75 = 75%
- 2/3 ≈ 0.67 = 66.7%

---

### 4. **Percentages & Decimals**

#### 🎯 Percentage Shortcuts:
| Find | Method | Example |
|------|--------|---------|
| 10% | ÷10 | 10% of 340 = 34 |
| 5% | 10% then halve | 5% of 340 = 17 |
| 20% | 10% then double | 20% of 340 = 68 |
| 25% | ÷4 | 25% of 84 = 21 |
| 50% | ÷2 | 50% of 84 = 42 |
| 75% | 50% + 25% | 75% of 84 = 42+21 = 63 |

#### 🎯 Decimal Operations:
- **×10**: Move decimal right (3.45 → 34.5)
- **÷10**: Move decimal left (3.45 → 0.345)
- **×100**: Move 2 places right
- **÷100**: Move 2 places left

#### 💡 Percentage Increase/Decrease:
- Increase by 20% = ×1.2
- Decrease by 20% = ×0.8
- Much faster than finding 20% then adding/subtracting!

### 5. **Algebra & Sequences**

#### 🎯 Solving Equations - The Balance Method:
Instead of formal algebra, think "what balances?"
- 2x + 5 = 13 → "What doubled plus 5 gives 13?" → x = 4

#### 🎯 Sequence Spotting:
1. **Check differences** between terms
2. **If differences are same** = arithmetic sequence
3. **If differences increase steadily** = quadratic pattern
4. **Look for ×2, ×3 patterns** = geometric sequence

Example: 3, 7, 11, 15...
- Differences: +4, +4, +4 → Next is 19

#### 💡 The nth Term Trick:
For arithmetic sequences: First term + (n-1) × difference
- Sequence: 5, 8, 11, 14...
- 10th term = 5 + (9×3) = 32

---

### 6. **Ratio & Proportion**

#### 🎯 The Share Method:
1. Add ratio parts (3:5 = 8 parts total)
2. Find one share (Total ÷ parts)
3. Multiply for each person

Example: Share £48 in ratio 3:5
- Total parts = 8
- One part = £48 ÷ 8 = £6
- Person A gets 3×£6 = £18
- Person B gets 5×£6 = £30

#### 🎯 Scaling Ratios:
- Always simplify first (12:18 = 2:3)
- To scale up: multiply both sides
- To scale down: divide both sides

#### 💡 Direct vs Inverse Proportion:
- **Direct**: More workers = less time (multiply one, divide other)
- **Inverse**: More speed = less time (both go same direction)

---

### 7. **Measurement & Units**

#### 🎯 Conversion Lightning Round:

**Length:**
- 10mm = 1cm
- 100cm = 1m
- 1000m = 1km

**Weight:**
- 1000g = 1kg
- 1000kg = 1 tonne

**Capacity:**
- 1000ml = 1L
- 100cl = 1L

**Time:**
- 60 seconds = 1 minute
- 60 minutes = 1 hour
- 24 hours = 1 day

#### 🎯 Area & Perimeter Tricks:
- **Rectangle**: Area must be bigger than biggest side
- **Square with area 64**: Side = 8 (memorise square numbers!)
- **Triangle area**: Always less than rectangle with same base/height

#### 💡 Volume Quick Check:
- Volume in cm³ must be bigger than area in cm²
- 1000cm³ = 1 litre (for water questions)

---

### 8. **Time, Speed & Distance**

#### 🎯 The Magic Triangle:
```
    Distance
   ─────────
Speed │ Time
```
Cover what you want to find!

#### 🎯 Clock Angles:
- **Minute hand**: 6° per minute (360°÷60)
- **Hour hand**: 30° per hour (360°÷12)
- **Hour hand also**: 0.5° per minute

#### 🎯 Time Calculations:
- **Adding time**: Add hours and minutes separately
- **Crossing noon/midnight**: Use 24-hour clock
- **Duration**: Count on, don't subtract

Example: 10:45 to 2:15
- 10:45 → 11:00 (15 min)
- 11:00 → 2:00 (3 hours)
- 2:00 → 2:15 (15 min)
- Total: 3 hours 30 minutes

#### 💡 Average Speed Trap:
Average speed ≠ (Speed1 + Speed2) ÷ 2
Use: Total distance ÷ Total time

---

### 9. **Geometry & Angles**

#### 🎯 Angle Rules Memory Bank:
- **Straight line** = 180°
- **Right angle** = 90°
- **Full turn** = 360°
- **Triangle angles** = 180°
- **Quadrilateral angles** = 360°

#### 🎯 Polygon Interior Angles:
- Formula: (n-2) × 180°
- Triangle (n=3): 180°
- Square (n=4): 360°
- Pentagon (n=5): 540°
- Hexagon (n=6): 720°

#### 🎯 Symmetry Speed Check:
- **Square**: 4 lines of symmetry
- **Rectangle**: 2 lines
- **Equilateral triangle**: 3 lines
- **Circle**: Infinite lines

#### 💡 Parallel Lines Rules:
- **Corresponding angles** (F-shape) = equal
- **Alternate angles** (Z-shape) = equal
- **Co-interior angles** (C-shape) = add to 180°

---

### 10. **Data Handling**

#### 🎯 Graph Reading Hacks:
1. **Check the scale first** (Is each square 1, 2, 5, or 10?)
2. **Read the title** (What's being measured?)
3. **Check units** (Thousands? Millions?)

#### 🎯 Average Shortcuts:
- **Mean**: Use grouping for similar numbers
  - 48, 52, 49, 51 → All near 50, mean ≈ 50
- **Median**: Just find the middle (order first!)
- **Mode**: Most common (look for repeats)
- **Range**: Biggest - Smallest

#### 🎯 Pie Chart Angles:
- 10% = 36°
- 25% = 90°
- 50% = 180°
- 75% = 270°

#### 💡 Probability Quick Rules:
- Probability is always between 0 and 1
- All probabilities add to 1
- P(not happening) = 1 - P(happening)

## 🚀 Power Techniques for ANY Question

### 1. **The Elimination Game**
Before calculating, eliminate using:
- **Size sense**: Too big? Too small?
- **Units check**: cm² for area, cm³ for volume
- **Last digit**: Multiplication endings
- **Odd/even logic**: Even × Odd = Even
- **Sign check**: Can't have negative length!

### 2. **Working Backwards**
Instead of solving, try each answer:
- "Which makes 3x + 7 = 22?"
- Try x = 5: 3(5) + 7 = 22 ✓

### 3. **The Compensation Method**
Make numbers friendly, then adjust:
- 99 × 7 = (100 × 7) - 7 = 693
- 298 + 456 = 300 + 456 - 2 = 754

### 4. **Pattern Recognition**
- Numbers ending in 5 squared end in 25
- Multiplying by even = even result
- Sum of angles in shapes follows pattern

## ⚠️ Common Traps to Avoid

1. **Unit Confusion**: Question in meters, answer wanted in cm
2. **Reading Error**: Asked for difference, not total
3. **Rounding Trap**: "How many whole buses?" Never round up!
4. **Scale Misread**: Each square might be 2, not 1
5. **Time Format**: Mixing 12-hour and 24-hour
6. **Inclusive Counting**: "From Monday to Friday" = 5 days, not 4

## 📝 Exam Day Strategy

### Before You Start:
- Scan the whole paper (2 minutes)
- Note any topics you find tricky
- Plan to do easy ones first

### During the Exam:
1. **Minutes 0-35**: First pass (all questions you can do)
2. **Minutes 35-45**: Second pass (flagged questions)
3. **Minutes 45-50**: Final check & educated guesses

### The 30-Second Rule:
If you can't see a path to the answer in 30 seconds, flag and move on!

### Emergency Strategies:
- **Stuck on last 5 questions?** Pick middle values
- **Running out of time?** Do 1-mark questions first
- **Can't eliminate any answers?** Skip extremes (highest/lowest)
