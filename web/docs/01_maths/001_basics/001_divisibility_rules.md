## ✨ Divisibility Rules

### 1️⃣ Divisible by 2

* If the last digit is **even** (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
  👉 Example: 248 ends with 8, so divisible by 2.

---

### 2️⃣ Divisible by 3

* If the **sum of digits** is divisible by 3.
  👉 Example: 372 → 3+7+2 = 12 → 12 is divisible by 3 → so is 372.

---

### 3️⃣ Divisible by 4

* If the **last two digits** form a number divisible by 4.
  👉 Example: 516 → last two digits 16 → divisible by 4 → so 516 is too.

---

### 4️⃣ Divisible by 5

* If the last digit is **0 or 5**.
  👉 Example: 1,235 ends in 5 → divisible by 5.

---

### 5️⃣ Divisible by 6

* If the number is divisible by **both 2 and 3**.
  👉 Example: 354 → ends in even (2 rule) and digit sum 12 divisible by 3 → so divisible by 6.

---

### 6️⃣ Divisible by 7

* Double the **last digit**, subtract it from the rest. If the result is divisible by 7, so is the number.
  👉 Example: 203 → Double last digit (3×2=6), subtract from 20 → 20–6=14 → divisible by 7 → so 203 is too.

*(This one takes practice!)*

---

### 7️⃣ Divisible by 8

* If the **last three digits** form a number divisible by 8.
  👉 Example: 4,712 → last three digits 712 → 712 ÷ 8 = 89 → so divisible by 8.

---

### 8️⃣ Divisible by 9

* If the **sum of digits** is divisible by 9.
  👉 Example: 7,182 → 7+1+8+2=18 → divisible by 9 → so is 7,182.

---

### 9️⃣ Divisible by 10

* If the last digit is **0**.
  👉 Example: 450 ends in 0 → divisible by 10.

---

### 🔟 Divisible by 11

* Find the **difference between the sum of digits in odd places and even places**.
* If that difference is 0 or divisible by 11, the number is divisible by 11.
  👉 Example: 3,652 → (3+5) – (6+2) = 8–8=0 → divisible by 11.

---

### 1️⃣2️⃣ Divisible by 12

* If the number is divisible by **both 3 and 4**.
  👉 Example: 516 → sum of digits 12 divisible by 3, last two digits 16 divisible by 4 → so divisible by 12.

---

✅ These are the most common rules up to 12. For bigger divisors (like 13, 17, 19), there are rules too, but they’re rarely used outside advanced math competitions.

---
That’s a smart question 👍 — because not every divisibility rule is equally important for the **11 Plus exam**. Let’s break it down clearly.

---

## 🎯 For the 11 Plus Exam, you should **master divisibility rules up to 12**

Here’s why:

* Most questions involve factors, multiples, LCM, HCF, fractions, and simplification — and these rely on divisibility.
* Divisibility rules beyond 12 (like 13, 17, 19) are rarely needed at this level.

So you should definitely know **2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12**.
👉 Rules for **7** are nice-to-have (sometimes they appear in trick questions).
👉 Rules for numbers **above 12** are **not needed**.

---

## 📌 How to actually USE these rules in 11 Plus

1. **Prime Factorisation / Simplifying Fractions**

   * Example: Simplify $\frac{84}{126}$.
   * Use divisibility rules:

     * Both even → divide by 2.
     * Now check if divisible by 3 (digit sum test).
   * Keep dividing until simplified.

---

2. **Finding Factors**

   * To find all factors of 72 quickly, check divisibility rules up to $\sqrt{72}$.
   * Rule for 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9 help you spot factors fast.

---

3. **LCM & HCF Problems**

   * Example: Find LCM of 18 and 24.
   * Factorise using divisibility rules (18 → 2×3×3, 24 → 2×2×2×3).
   * Helps combine prime factors easily.

---

4. **Checking Multiples in Word Problems**

   * E.g. “A shop packs pencils in boxes of 6. A school orders 132 pencils. Will they fit into full boxes?”
   * Use divisibility by 6 rule → 132 is divisible by 6, so yes.

---

5. **Quick Mental Maths**

   * Example: Is 5,832 divisible by 9?
   * Digit sum = 18 → yes, so you know instantly without dividing.

---

✅ Mastery tip:

* For **basic speed**, know 2, 3, 5, 10 off by heart.
* For **factors/LCM/HCF**, also master 4, 6, 8, 9, 12.
* For **occasional tricky questions**, learn 7 and 11.

## 1. ✅ Key Divisibility Rules to Master

* **Basic:** 2, 3, 5, 10
* **Important for fractions & factors:** 4, 6, 8, 9, 12
* **Occasional exam trick:** 7, 11

---

## 2. 📘 Worked Examples

### Example A – Simplifying Fractions

Simplify $\frac{126}{168}$.

* Both end in even → divide by 2 → $\frac{63}{84}$
* 6+3 = 9 → divisible by 3 → $\frac{21}{28}$
* Both divisible by 7 (rule for 7: 28 ÷ 7 = 4) → $\frac{3}{4}$

✅ Final Answer: $\frac{3}{4}$

---

### Example B – Finding HCF

Find the **HCF of 108 and 144**.

* 108 → check rules: even → ÷2 = 54 → still even → ÷2 = 27 → sum of digits 2+7=9 → divisible by 9 → factors = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3
* 144 → keep dividing → 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3
* Common = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 = 36

✅ HCF = 36

---

### Example C – Finding LCM

Find the **LCM of 18 and 24**.

* 18 → 2 × 3 × 3
* 24 → 2 × 2 × 2 × 3
* Take highest powers: 2³ × 3² = 72

✅ LCM = 72

---

### Example D – Word Problem

“A hall has 132 chairs. They are to be arranged in rows of 6. Will there be any chairs left over?”

* Check divisibility by 6:

  * Last digit is even → divisible by 2
  * Sum of digits 1+3+2=6 → divisible by 3
* So divisible by 6 → No chairs left over.

✅ Answer: No chairs left over.
