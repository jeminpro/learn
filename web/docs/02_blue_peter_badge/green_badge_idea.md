## 💌 4. LETTER TO BLUE PETER

**To:** The Blue Peter Team
**From:** [Your Son’s Name], Age 9

---

**Dear Blue Peter,**

My name is [Name] and I’m 9 years old. I did a project called **“My Zero-Waste Cooking Day.”**
I wanted to see if I could make breakfast, lunch, and dinner from the same ingredients without throwing anything away.

For breakfast I made **Veg Open Toasties**, for lunch **Chicken and Mushroom Soup with Croutons**, and for dinner **Chicken and Egg Fried Rice**.

To avoid waste I **composted eggshells**, **froze extra soup**, **kept coriander in the fridge**, and **regrew spring-onion roots in water.**
I learned that planning ahead helps save food, money, and the planet.

### 🌿 Reflection

Next time I’ll make my project better by buying vegetables **locally from a farm**, using **seasonal ingredients**, and **teaching my friends** how to try their own zero-waste challenge.

Thank you for inspiring me to care about food waste and the environment.

Best wishes,
**[First Name] (9)**
