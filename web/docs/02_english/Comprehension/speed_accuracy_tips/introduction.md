# 🧠 11+ Multiple-Choice Comprehension – Tips & Tricks

These papers test **speed**, **understanding**, and **accuracy** — not long written answers.  
The goal is to **spot clues quickly**, **avoid traps**, and **choose the most accurate option**.

---

## 📖 1. Read Smart – Skim Once and Underline Clues

You don’t have time to read twice.

✅ **Step 1:** Skim the passage quickly for the main idea.  
✅ **Step 2:** Underline or highlight key clues:
- Names and pronouns (who, where, when)  
- Feelings or mood changes  
- Connectives (but, although, suddenly, however)  
- Strong adjectives or verbs  

Then go straight to **Question 1** — you’ll revisit parts of the text as you go.

---

## 🧩 2. Read the Question Carefully

Every question gives you a **clue word** — underline it!

✅ Look for:
- “main idea”, “feeling”, “effect”, “means”, “suggests”  
- Words like *not*, *always*, *never* that reverse meaning  

**Example:**  
> Which word is **not similar** to “angry”?  
Underline “not”! Most mistakes happen because it’s missed.

---

## 🎯 3. Eliminate Wrong Answers First

Most questions have **one correct**, **one almost right**, and **two wrong** options.

✅ Cross out obvious wrongs quickly.  
✅ Between two close ones, check **which fits the whole sentence or tone**.  
✅ If unsure, pick the answer that matches the **mood** of the passage.

**Tip:** Wrong answers often sound too extreme, or don’t match the text’s feeling.

---

## 🧠 4. Question Order Helps You

The questions usually follow the **same order as the passage**.  
So when you finish one, the next answer is often found in the **next paragraph**.

👉 This helps you move through the text logically — no jumping back and forth.

---

## 💬 5. Vocabulary / Meaning Questions

When asked what a word means:
1. Read the full sentence again.  
2. Think: does the word sound **positive or negative**?  
3. Replace it mentally with a simple synonym.  
4. Choose the option that fits best.

✅ Ignore dictionary meanings — choose what fits **in context**.

**Example:**  
> “He trudged home through the rain.”  
“Trudged” = walked **slowly and tiredly**, not just “walked”.

---

## 💥 6. Inference Questions (Reading Between the Lines)

You won’t find the answer directly.  
Ask yourself: *What does this show? What does this tell me about the character?*

✅ Check verbs, emotions, or body language.  
✅ Avoid dramatic guesses — stick to clues in the text.

**Example:**  
> “Ben stared at his shoes.” → He’s probably **embarrassed or guilty**, not just looking down.

---

## 🔍 7. Tone and Feeling Questions

When asked how a character feels or what the tone is:
- Check emotion words, punctuation (!, …, ?)
- Look for verbs that reveal attitude (snapped, sighed, whispered)
- Read the whole sentence, not just one word

| Clue | Feeling |
|------|----------|
| “She clenched her fists.” | Angry or tense |
| “He shuffled away.” | Sad or ashamed |
| “He grinned widely.” | Happy or relieved |

---

## 🧾 8. True / False / Not Given (if included)

✅ **True** → clearly stated in the text  
✅ **False** → clearly opposite of what’s in the text  
✅ **Not Given** → not mentioned at all  

Don’t overthink — if it’s not there, mark “Not Given”.

---

## ⏰ 9. Manage Your Time Wisely

Typical format: 1 passage + 10–15 questions in 20–25 minutes.

**Plan:**
- 2 minutes skim + underline clues  
- 15–18 minutes answering  
- 2–3 minutes check skipped ones  

✅ Don’t get stuck — guess, mark, move on, and return later.

---

## ⚡ 10. Common Examiner Tricks

| Trap | How to Avoid |
|------|---------------|
| ❌ “Not” hidden in question | Underline it immediately |
| ❌ Options too general | Pick the most specific one |
| ❌ Emotional misdirection | Match the tone of the text |
| ❌ Two similar answers | Check which one fits *every* clue |
| ❌ Outside knowledge | Base answer only on passage |

---

## 📚 11. Practice Like the Real Test

When practising:
- Use a timer ⏱️  
- Don’t read twice — skim, underline, move on  
- Don’t guess wildly — **cross out wrongs first**  
- Read options fully before selecting  

**Best approach:**  
> “Scan → Eliminate → Confirm”
