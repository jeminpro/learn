# 🧱 Capital Letters

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Capital letters show **beginnings** and **importance**.  
They signal new sentences and highlight **proper nouns**, helping readers see names, places, and special titles instantly.

---

## 🧩 1. When to Use Capital Letters

### **1️⃣ Beginning of a Sentence**
Every complete sentence must start with a capital letter.

✅ *Examples:*  
- The train left early.  
- She smiled at the camera.  

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> the train left early.

---

### **2️⃣ The Pronoun “I”**
“I” is **always capitalised**, even in the middle of a sentence.

✅ *Example:*  
> My brother and I went swimming.  

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> my brother and i went swimming.

---

### **3️⃣ Proper Nouns (Names of People, Places, etc.)**
Capitalise all **specific names**.

✅ *Examples:*  
- People: **Harry Potter**, **Dr Singh**  
- Places: **London**, **River Thames**, **Mount Everest**  
- Organisations: **NASA**, **National Trust**  
- Days/Months/Festivals: **Monday**, **December**, **Christmas**  
- Languages/Nationalities: **French**, **Indian**, **English**

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> We visited paris in august.

---

### **4️⃣ Titles of Works**
Capitalize **main words** in book, film, poem, or story titles.

✅ *Example:*  
> *The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*

🧠 *Rule of Thumb:*  
Capitalize **nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns**, not small joining words unless they start the title.

---

### **5️⃣ First Word in Direct Speech**
Whenever a character speaks, the first word inside the quotation marks starts with a capital.

✅ *Example:*  
> The teacher said, “Everyone must be seated.”  

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> The teacher said, “everyone must be seated.”

---

### **6️⃣ Acronyms and Initialisms**
Each letter stands for a full word → capitalise all letters.

✅ *Examples:*  
- **BBC**, **UNICEF**, **FIFA**
