# ➖ Dashes, Brackets, and Hyphens

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Dashes, brackets, and hyphens all help **add extra information**, **clarify meaning**, or **join ideas** — but they each create a different *tone* and *effect*.  
Knowing when to use which is a key higher-level punctuation skill in 11+ writing.

---

## 🧩 1. The Dash (—)

### **1️⃣ To Add Extra Information**
Dashes can replace commas or brackets for **extra detail** or **dramatic effect**.

✅ *Examples:*  
- My brother — the noisy one — broke the vase.  
- The room — dark and silent — felt eerie.

💡 *Tip:* Use a **pair** of dashes (like two brackets) if the information sits in the middle.

---

### **2️⃣ To Emphasise or Interrupt**
Dashes can mark a **pause**, **change of tone**, or **sudden thought**.

✅ *Examples:*  
- I opened the box — and gasped.  
- She looked at me — what was she thinking?

💡 *Tone effect:* More dramatic or informal than commas or brackets.

---

### **3️⃣ To Show Afterthoughts or Conclusions**
✅ *Examples:*  
- There was only one problem — we’d missed the bus.  
- He knew what it meant — failure.

---

## 🧩 2. Brackets (Parentheses) ( )

Brackets are used to add **extra, non-essential** information — like a quiet whisper in the sentence.  
If the bracketed information is removed, the sentence should still make sense.

✅ *Examples:*  
- My sister (who lives abroad) is coming home.  
- The cake (fresh from the oven) smelled delicious.

💡 *Tone effect:* More formal and neutral than dashes; used in factual or explanatory writing.

---

### ⚠️ Punctuation Rule
If the whole sentence is inside brackets, end punctuation goes **inside**.
If not, it goes **outside**.

✅ *Examples:*  
- (The cat slept all day.)  
- The cat slept (as usual).

---

## 🧩 3. The Hyphen (-)

Hyphens **join words** to form compound adjectives or avoid confusion.

✅ *Examples:*  
- A well-known author.  
- Sugar-free sweets.  
- A ten-year-old child.  

💡 *Rule:* If two or more words describe a noun **together**, join them with a hyphen.

> A man-eating shark ≠ A man eating shark 🦈  

---

### **2️⃣ To Avoid Awkward Doubles or Misreading**
✅ *Examples:*  
- Re-cover (cover again) ≠ Recover (get better).  
- Co-operate, re-enter, pre-school.

---

### **3️⃣ Numbers and Fractions**
✅ *Examples:*  
- Twenty-one, two-thirds, one-half.

## ⚖️ 4. Comparing the Three Marks

| Mark | Function | Example | Tone/Effect |
|------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| **Dash (—)** | Adds drama or interruption | He laughed — loudly. | Informal, strong impact |
| **Brackets ( )** | Adds extra detail quietly | The dog (a golden retriever) barked. | Formal, factual tone |
| **Hyphen (-)** | Joins words | A well-known writer. | Neutral, structural |

## ⚠️ 5. Common 11+ Traps

### ❌ **Using only one dash in the middle**
> My mum — who loves baking, made a cake. ❌  
✅ My mum — who loves baking — made a cake.  

---

### ❌ **Mixing dashes and commas**
> The dog, who was hungry — ate fast. ❌  

---

### ❌ **Adding spaces around hyphens**
> sugar - free sweets ❌ → sugar-free sweets ✅  

---

### ❌ **Overusing brackets**
> The dog (brown and lazy) (very friendly) (liked food). ❌  

---

### ❌ **Hyphenating when not needed**
> very-big house ❌ → very big house ✅

## 🧠 6. Teaching Tips

- **Visual Cue:**  
  - Brackets = whisper (quiet info)  
  - Dashes = shout (dramatic info)  
  - Hyphen = glue (joins words)
- Have your child rewrite the same sentence using all three and discuss tone change:
  > My friend (who is clever) solved it.  
  > My friend — who is clever — solved it.  
  > My clever friend solved it.
- Colour-code worksheets:  
  - 🟩 Hyphen joins  
  - 🟦 Brackets enclose  
  - 🟥 Dashes emphasise
