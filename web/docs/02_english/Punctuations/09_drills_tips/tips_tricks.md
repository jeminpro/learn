# 🕵️‍♂️ Punctuation Checking Strategy & Spotting Tricks  
*(11+ Editing & Writing Guide)*

---

## 🎯 Goal
To make punctuation spotting **easy, logical, and foolproof.**  
Instead of guessing, follow a clear **checking order** — just like an editor.

---

## 🧭 1. The Golden Order — Always Check in This Sequence

1️⃣ **Sentence Endings →**  
   Full stops, question marks, exclamation marks.  
   - Every sentence must **end** properly.  
   - Ask: *Is this a statement, a question, or emotion?*

2️⃣ **Capital Letters →**  
   - Start of each sentence.  
   - Names, places, days, months, “I”.

3️⃣ **Apostrophes →**  
   - For **possession** and **contraction.**  
   - Ask: *Does it show ownership or missing letters?*

4️⃣ **Commas →**  
   - Lists, fronted adverbials, clauses, direct address.  
   - Read aloud — where would you pause *slightly*, not stop?

5️⃣ **Speech Marks →**  
   - Around exact words spoken.  
   - Check for commas inside, capital letters, and new line for each speaker.

6️⃣ **Colons & Semicolons →**  
   - Colons introduce; semicolons link related sentences.  
   - Ask: *Does this explain something or balance two ideas?*

7️⃣ **Dashes, Brackets & Hyphens →**  
   - Dashes = dramatic; Brackets = factual; Hyphen = join words.  
   - Ask: *Is it extra info or a joining word?*

8️⃣ **Ellipsis →**  
   - Only 3 dots. Used for pause, suspense, or omission.

## 🧠 2. Quick Memory Tricks (Mnemonics)

| Type | Mnemonic | Meaning |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Sentence Endings** | 🟢 **“FQE” – Finish, Question, Emotion** | Full stop, Question mark, Exclamation mark |
| **Apostrophes** | 🧩 **“O or M?” – Ownership or Missing** | Decide if it’s possession or contraction |
| **Commas** | 🍃 **“Breathe Rule”** | If you pause but don’t stop — comma |
| **Speech Marks** | 💬 **“Speak, Comma, Said”** | “Speech,” said ___ |
| **Colons vs Semicolons** | ⚖️ **“Points or Balances”** | Colon → points forward; Semicolon → balances |
| **Dashes vs Brackets** | 🎭 **“Drama vs Whisper”** | Dash = drama; Brackets = quiet info |
| **Hyphen** | 🔗 **“Hyphen = Glue”** | Joins words that act as one adjective |
| **Ellipsis** | 🌫️ **“Three dots of mystery”** | No more, no less |

## 🔍 3. Spotting Strategy (Step-by-Step)

**Step 1 — Read Aloud, Slowly.**  
> If it sounds like you should stop — check full stop or semicolon.  
> If it sounds like you should pause — check for a comma.

**Step 2 — Find Clauses.**  
Each **clause = subject + verb** → see how they connect.  
> Two full clauses = need full stop, semicolon, or conjunction.

**Step 3 — Check Openers.**  
If the sentence starts with words like *After, Before, When, Because, Although…* →  
you almost always need a **comma** after the first phrase.

**Step 4 — Check Possession.**  
Circle any **word ending in s.**  
Ask: *Is it plural, singular, or owning something?*

**Step 5 — Look at Names & Dialogue.**  
Capital letters for proper nouns.  
Speech marks correctly placed? New line for new speaker?

**Step 6 — Final Sweep.**  
Run eyes over page — long sentences often hide **missing commas or semicolons**.  
Short ones may need linking or variation.

## 🎯 4. How to Double-Check Your Work in 2 Minutes

| Time | Focus | What to Ask |
|------|--------|-------------|
| ⏱️ 0:00–0:30 | Sentence endings | Are all sentences complete? |
| ⏱️ 0:30–1:00 | Capitals & names | Every new line starts right? |
| ⏱️ 1:00–1:30 | Commas & apostrophes | Are pauses & ownership marked? |
| ⏱️ 1:30–2:00 | Extras | Speech marks, colons, dashes, ellipsis used correctly? |

💡 *Tip:* A green highlighter for commas, blue for capitals, and orange for apostrophes can train the eye to notice missing marks visually.

## 🧩 5. Common 11+ Red Flags 🚨

❌ **Comma Splice** – Two sentences joined by a comma  
> It was late, we went home.  
✅ Fix → It was late; we went home.  

❌ **Its vs It’s**  
> The cat licked it’s paw ❌ → The cat licked its paw ✅  

❌ **Speech Comma**  
> “I’m here”. said Jake ❌ → “I’m here,” said Jake ✅  

❌ **Random Capitals**  
> We went To The Park ❌  

❌ **Overused Ellipsis or !**  
> I love pizza!!! Or ... every two words... ❌

## 🧠 6. Practice Routine

1️⃣ Pick one **paragraph from a story** daily.  
2️⃣ Remove all punctuation.  
3️⃣ Let your child repunctuate it fully.  
4️⃣ Then compare with the original.  
5️⃣ Discuss: *Which punctuation changed meaning or tone most?*

💡 *Variation:* Swap roles — you punctuate *wrongly on purpose* and they “debug” it!
