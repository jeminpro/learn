# ✏️ Sentence Endings (Full Stop, Question Mark, Exclamation Mark)

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Sentence endings show the **type of sentence** and **tone** of what’s being said.  
Using the wrong ending changes meaning, emotion, or grammar.

---

## 🧩 1. The Three Main End Marks

### **1️⃣ Full Stop ( . )**
Used to end a **statement** — something that tells us a fact, opinion, or command said calmly.

✅ *Examples:*  
- The cat slept on the sofa.  
- London is the capital of England.  
- Please close the door quietly.

💡 *Tip:* Think of it as a traffic light — it tells the reader to **stop and breathe**.

---

### **2️⃣ Question Mark ( ? )**
Used at the end of a **direct question** — when someone is asking something.

✅ *Examples:*  
- What time is it?  
- Did you finish your homework?  
- Why are you laughing?

🚫 *Do NOT* use for indirect questions:  
> I asked what time it was. ✅ (no question mark)

---

### **3️⃣ Exclamation Mark ( ! )**
Used to show **strong feeling**, **command**, or **surprise**.  
Can end a statement, command, or exclamation.

✅ *Examples:*  
- Stop!  
- What a beautiful day!  
- That’s incredible!

🚫 *Overuse warning:* Too many exclamation marks make writing sound childish or forced.

## ⚠️ 3. Common Traps & 11+ Pitfalls

### ❌ **Comma Splice**
Using a comma instead of a full stop or joining word.  
> It was late, we went home. ❌  
> It was late. We went home. ✅  
> It was late, so we went home. ✅

---

### ❌ **Overusing Exclamation Marks**
> I went to school! It was fun! I met my friend! ❌  
Use only for genuine emotion or strong emphasis.

---

### ❌ **No End Punctuation**
Forgetting a full stop or question mark makes writing seem rushed and unclear.

---

### ❌ **Indirect Questions**
> She asked if I was coming? ❌  
> She asked if I was coming. ✅

## 🧠 4. Quick Tips for Teaching

- Use **colour cards**: green (.), blue (?), red (!)  
- Read a short paragraph aloud — ask your child to *say what punctuation fits at the end*.  
- Play **“Spot the sentence type”** with everyday lines (“Did you brush your teeth?” “Go upstairs.” “It’s bedtime!”).  
- Encourage reading aloud with expression — punctuation controls voice tone.
