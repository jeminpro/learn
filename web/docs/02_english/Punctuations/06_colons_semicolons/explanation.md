# ⚖️ Colons and Semicolons

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Colons (:) and semicolons (;) both link ideas and show close relationships between parts of a sentence.  
They make writing clear, logical, and mature — exactly what examiners look for at 11+.

---

## 🧩 1. The Colon (:)

### **1️⃣ Introducing or Explaining**
A colon is used to introduce an **explanation, example, or list** that completes the first clause.

✅ *Examples:*  
- I knew exactly what to do: run.  
- He has one big dream: to be a pilot.  
- The teacher reminded us: always show your working.

🧠 *Test:* If the second part **explains** or **proves** the first, use a colon.

---

### **2️⃣ Before a List**
Use a colon when introducing a list after a complete sentence.

✅ *Examples:*  
- You will need: a pencil, a ruler, and a sharpener.  
- There are three main colours: red, yellow, and blue.

🚫 *Don’t use* a colon right after a verb or preposition.

> ❌ Bring: a pencil, a ruler, and a sharpener.  
> ✅ Bring a pencil, a ruler, and a sharpener.

---

### **3️⃣ Between Title and Subtitle**
✅ *Examples:*  
- *Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe*  
- *Volcanoes: The Science Behind the Eruptions*

---

### **4️⃣ To Emphasise or Reveal**
✅ *Examples:*  
- There’s only one problem: time.  
- He knew what it meant: failure.

---

## 🧩 2. The Semicolon (;)

A semicolon is **stronger than a comma but weaker than a full stop**.  
It links two **complete sentences** that are closely related.

✅ *Examples:*  
- The sun was setting; the sky glowed pink.  
- It was raining; we decided to stay home.  
- I wanted to go; however, it was too late.

🧠 *Rule:* Each side of a semicolon must be a **complete sentence**.

---

### **2️⃣ Lists with Commas**
Use semicolons to separate items in a **long list** that already contains commas.

✅ *Example:*  
- On our trip we visited Bath, England; Paris, France; and Rome, Italy.

## ⚖️ 3. Colon vs Semicolon — How to Decide

| Function | Use a Colon (:) | Use a Semicolon (;) |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| To explain or give reason | I was scared: the room was dark. | — |
| To join related sentences | — | It was dark; I was scared. |
| Before a list | Bring the following: pens, pencils, rulers. | — |
| Between equal ideas | — | She laughed; he didn’t. |
| In complex lists | — | Apples, red; bananas, yellow; grapes, green. |

💡 *Tip:*  
→ Colon **points forward** (to an explanation).  
→ Semicolon **balances** two ideas.

## ⚠️ 4. Common 11+ Traps

### ❌ **Using a colon after an incomplete sentence**
> Bring the following are: pens, rulers. ❌  
✅ Bring the following: pens, rulers.

---

### ❌ **Using a semicolon where a comma or conjunction is needed**
> It was late; and we went home. ❌  
✅ It was late, and we went home. ✅  
✅ It was late; we went home. ✅

---

### ❌ **Using a semicolon with incomplete clauses**
> Because it was raining; we stayed inside. ❌  
✅ Because it was raining, we stayed inside. ✅

---

### ❌ **Overusing them**
Use sparingly — one or two per paragraph is often enough.

## 🧠 5. Teaching Tips

- Visual trick:  
  - **Colon = “leads to” →** (explains what follows).  
  - **Semicolon = “balances” ↔** (links two full ideas).  
- Use **sentence cards**: one with “cause”, one with “effect” → join using the right mark.  
- Ask your child to **test both halves** of a sentence — can they stand alone? → If yes, semicolon fits.
