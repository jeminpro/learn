# ✒️ Apostrophes

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Apostrophes show **either**  
1️⃣ **Missing letters** (contractions)  
2️⃣ **Ownership** (possession)  

They are tiny marks with a big impact — one misplaced apostrophe can completely change meaning.

---

## 🧩 1. Apostrophes for Contractions
A contraction shortens a pair of words by removing letters.  
The apostrophe shows where the letters are missing.

✅ *Examples:*  
| Long Form | Short Form | Meaning |
|------------|-------------|----------|
| do not | don’t | o is missing |
| cannot | can’t | no is missing |
| I will | I’ll | wi is missing |
| they are | they’re | a is missing |
| it is / it has | it’s | letters missing |

💡 *Tip:* Say the full form aloud — if it sounds like **two words squashed together**, it’s a contraction.

---

### ⚠️ Trap: **its vs it’s**
| Form | Meaning | Example |
|-------|----------|----------|
| **it’s** | *it is* or *it has* | It’s raining outside. |
| **its** | shows *possession* | The dog wagged its tail. |

🧠 *Rule:* If you can’t expand it to *it is* or *it has*, don’t use an apostrophe.

## 🧩 2. Apostrophes for Possession

### **a. Singular Possession**
Add **’s** to show something belongs to one person or thing.

✅ *Examples:*  
- The **girl’s** book. (book of one girl)  
- The **dog’s** bone. (bone of one dog)  
- The **child’s** toy. (toy of one child)

---

### **b. Plural Possession**
If a plural ends in **s**, add the apostrophe **after** the s.

✅ *Examples:*  
- The **girls’** bags. (bags of several girls)  
- The **dogs’** tails. (tails of several dogs)

If a plural **does not** end in s, add **’s**.

✅ *Examples:*  
- The **children’s** playground.  
- The **men’s** shoes.  
- The **people’s** choice.

---

### **c. Shared vs Individual Possession**
- **Shared:** one apostrophe → *Ben and Tom’s room* (they share one room).  
- **Separate:** repeat ’s → *Ben’s and Tom’s rooms* (each has his own).

## 🧠 4. Teaching Tips

- Use **word cards**: one side with full form (“do not”), other with contraction (“don’t”).  
- Draw arrows from owner → thing owned to visualise possession.  
- Let your child decide: *Is it showing missing letters or ownership?*  
- Use **sentence sorters**: mix plurals, contractions, and possessives — sort them correctly.
