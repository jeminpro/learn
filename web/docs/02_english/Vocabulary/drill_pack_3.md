### 💬 Study Tip
For high-level vocabulary:
1. Keep a “word notebook” — one new word a day, with **synonym, antonym, and sentence**.  
2. Use words in **speaking and writing** — retention improves 10×.  
3. Read across genres — news articles, classics, and science reports introduce richer vocabulary than storybooks alone.
