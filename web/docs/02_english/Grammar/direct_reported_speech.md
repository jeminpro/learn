# 🧩 Direct and Reported Speech
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

**Speech** in English can be written in two ways:

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Direct Speech** | The **exact words** spoken, shown inside quotation marks. | *Tom said, “I am tired.”* |
| **Reported (Indirect) Speech** | The **meaning** of what was said, without quotation marks. | *Tom said that he was tired.* |

In **reported speech**, we often change:
- **Tenses**
- **Pronouns**
- **Time words**

This is called **backshifting** (moving tense backwards one step).

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Quotation Marks** | Used in direct speech to show exact words spoken | *“I like cake,” said Sarah.* |
| **Reporting Verb** | The verb that introduces speech (say, tell, ask, reply) | *He said that…* |
| **Backshift** | Changing verb tense one step back in reported speech | *“I eat” → He said he **ate.*** |
| **Pronoun Change** | Adjusting who is speaking | *“I” → he/she; “my” → his/her* |
| **Time Shift** | Changing time words | *today → that day, tomorrow → the next day* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Direct Speech | Reported Speech | Explanation |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| “I am tired,” said Ben. | Ben said **he was tired.** | Present → past. |
| “I will come tomorrow,” she said. | She said **she would come the next day.** | “will” → “would”, “tomorrow” → “the next day.” |
| “We are studying English,” they said. | They said **they were studying English.** | Present continuous → past continuous. |
| “I have finished my work,” he said. | He said **he had finished his work.** | Present perfect → past perfect. |
| “I can swim,” Lily said. | Lily said **she could swim.** | “can” → “could.” |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- **No quotation marks** in reported speech.  
  ❌ *He said “that he was tired.”* → ✅ *He said that he was tired.*

- **Pronouns** change to match the new speaker:  
  *“I love my cat,” said Emma → Emma said she loved her cat.*

- **Tense backshift table** (most common):
  | Direct Speech | Reported Speech |
  |----------------|-----------------|
  | am/is → was | “I am happy” → He said he was happy. |
  | are → were | “We are late” → They said they were late. |
  | have/has → had | “I have finished” → She said she had finished. |
  | will → would | “I will go” → He said he would go. |
  | can → could | “I can help” → He said he could help. |
  | may → might | “I may come” → She said she might come. |

- When the reporting verb is in **present tense** (“He says…”),  
  the tense usually **does not change**.  
  *He says, “I am hungry.” → He says he is hungry.*

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Play **“Reporter Mode”**:
1. Say a few sentences aloud as “Direct Speech” (e.g., *Mum said, “I am cooking dinner.”*).  
2. Ask your child to **“report”** it like a news presenter (*Mum said she was cooking dinner.*).  
3. Then reverse the game — you say the reported version, and they must “quote” it back into direct speech.

Fun, interactive, and perfect practice for GL-style grammar reasoning!
