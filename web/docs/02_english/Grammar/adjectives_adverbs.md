# 🧩 Adjectives and Adverbs Usage
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

**Adjectives** and **adverbs** are describing words — they add detail to sentences.  
But they describe **different things**:

| Type | Describes | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| **Adjective** | a **noun** (person, place, or thing) | *The **happy** child laughed.* |
| **Adverb** | a **verb**, **adjective**, or **another adverb** | *The child laughed **loudly.*** |

Most adverbs end in **-ly**, but not all (e.g., *fast, well, hard*).

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Comparative** | Compares two things | *bigger, smaller, more careful* |
| **Superlative** | Compares three or more things | *biggest, smallest, most careful* |
| **Modifier** | A word that describes or limits another | *She sings **beautifully.*** |
| **Misplaced Modifier** | A word in the wrong position that causes confusion | *❌ She nearly ate ten biscuits (she didn’t eat any!).* |
| **Intensifier** | Adverb that strengthens meaning | *very, extremely, absolutely* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Sentence | Explanation |
|-----------|--------------|
| *The tall tree swayed gently.* | **Adjective** = “tall”; **Adverb** = “gently.” |
| *The cat is lazy.* | Adjective after the linking verb “is.” |
| *He ran quickly.* | Adverb describing “ran.” |
| *This test is harder than that one.* | Comparative adjective. |
| *She sang the most beautifully of all.* | Superlative adverb. |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- Some adjectives and adverbs **don’t follow the “-ly” rule**:  
  - Adjective: *fast car* → Adverb: *run fast* (not “fastly”)  
  - Adjective: *good student* → Adverb: *works well* (not “goodly”)
- Don’t use both **more** and **-er** together:  
  ❌ *more better* → ✅ *better*
- **Misplaced modifiers** can change meaning:  
  - *She almost failed every test.* (means she didn’t fail!)  
  - *She failed almost every test.* (means she failed most of them)
- Be careful with **linking verbs** (*is, seem, feel, become*):  
  They take **adjectives**, not adverbs.  
  ❌ *I feel badly today.* → ✅ *I feel bad today.*
