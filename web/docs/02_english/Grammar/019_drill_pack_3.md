### 💬 Teaching Tip
Turn this into a **mock exam round**:  
1. 20 questions → 10 minutes timer.  
2. +1 point for correct, −½ for careless error.  
3. Review mistakes by *grammar rule*, not by question number — helps reveal weak zones faster (e.g. “still confusing passive voice” or “mixing tenses”).
