# 🧩 Sentence Structure
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

A **sentence** is a group of words that makes **complete sense**.  
Every complete sentence must have:
- a **subject** – who or what the sentence is about  
- a **verb** – what the subject does or is  
- and it must form a **complete thought** on its own.

> Example: *The dog barked loudly.*  
> Subject = “The dog”  
> Verb = “barked”

### 🧩 What is a Clause?
A **clause** is a group of words that has its own **subject** and **verb**.

There are two main types:
| Type | Explanation | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Main Clause** | Can stand alone as a sentence. | *The dog barked.* |
| **Subordinate Clause** | Depends on the main clause to make sense. | *because it was hungry* (not a full sentence alone) |

---

### 🧱 Types of Sentences

| Type | Description | Example |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| **Simple Sentence** | Has one main clause (one idea). | *The cat slept.* |
| **Compound Sentence** | Has two main clauses joined by a **coordinating conjunction** (for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so). | *The cat slept, and the dog barked.* |
| **Complex Sentence** | Has a main clause + a subordinate clause. | *The cat slept because it was tired.* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Sentence | Type | Explanation |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| *I like apples.* | Simple | One main idea. |
| *I like apples, and I eat them every day.* | Compound | Two main ideas joined by “and”. |
| *I eat apples because they are healthy.* | Complex | “because they are healthy” depends on the main clause. |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits
- A **sentence fragment** (incomplete sentence) is **not** a full idea.  
  ❌ *Because it was raining.* → ❌ Not complete.  
  ✅ *I stayed inside because it was raining.* → ✅ Complete.

- Don’t add commas before “because” unless needed for clarity.  
  ✅ *I stayed home because I was tired.*

- A **clause** must have a **verb** — check for it when testing if a sentence is complete.

## 💡 How This Appears in the GL 11+ Exam
- GL often asks:  
  🟩 *“Which sentence is complete and makes sense?”*  
  🟩 *“Which joining word (conjunction) fits best?”*  
  🟩 *“Which sentence is correct?”*  

- Understanding sentence structure helps with:
  - Grammar correction questions  
  - Comprehension (spotting the main idea)  
  - Sentence improvement tasks

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Turn this into a **Sentence-Building Game**:
1. Write subjects, verbs, and joining words on coloured cards.  
2. Ask your child to *build* a simple → compound → complex sentence by adding pieces.  
3. Say each aloud and check if it “makes sense” as a complete idea.  

Visual + verbal = stronger long-term understanding.
