# Sentence Combination and Transformation

---

## 🧠 Explanation

**Sentence combination** means joining two or more short sentences into one longer, smoother sentence.  
**Sentence transformation** means changing the **type** or **structure** of a sentence while keeping the **meaning the same**.

These skills are tested in the GL exam through sentence correction and improvement questions.

### 🧩 1. Combining Sentences

We can combine sentences using:
1. **Conjunctions (joining words)**
2. **Relative pronouns**
3. **Punctuation (commas, semicolons)**

#### Using Coordinating Conjunctions  
Used to join two **main clauses** (equal ideas).

> **for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so**

Example:  
*I wanted to go out. It was raining.*  
→ *I wanted to go out, **but** it was raining.*

#### Using Subordinating Conjunctions  
Used to join a **main clause** and a **subordinate clause** (unequal ideas).

> **because, although, when, since, if, while**

Example:  
*She was tired. She stayed up late.*  
→ *She stayed up late **although** she was tired.*

#### Using Relative Pronouns  
> **who, which, that, whose, where**

Example:  
*I met a girl. She plays the piano.*  
→ *I met a girl **who** plays the piano.*

### 🧩 2. Transforming Sentences

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Statement** | Tells a fact | *The train is late.* |
| **Question** | Asks something | *Is the train late?* |
| **Command (Imperative)** | Gives an order | *Close the window.* |
| **Exclamation** | Shows emotion | *What a fast train!* |

Transformation examples:
- Statement → Question: *You are ready.* → *Are you ready?*  
- Statement → Command: *You must open the door.* → *Open the door!*  
- Statement → Exclamation: *It is a beautiful day.* → *What a beautiful day!*

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Clause** | A group of words with a subject and a verb | *She ran.* |
| **Conjunction** | A word that joins ideas | *because, and, but* |
| **Relative Clause** | Gives extra information about a noun | *The man **who smiled** is my teacher.* |
| **Transformation** | Changing sentence type or structure | *He ran quickly → What a quick runner he is!* |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- Don’t join sentences with **just a comma** (comma splice).  
  ❌ *I was tired, I went to bed.*  
  ✅ *I was tired, **so** I went to bed.*  
  ✅ *I was tired; I went to bed.*

- Make sure both clauses make sense together.  
  ❌ *He ate dinner because it was red.* (nonsense!)

- When changing questions, remember to flip the subject and verb:  
  *You are happy → Are you happy?*

- Exclamations must express strong feeling and usually start with *What* or *How*:  
  *What a mess!* / *How beautiful it looks!*

## 💡 How This Appears in the GL 11+ Exam

GL might ask:
- *“Choose the best way to join these sentences.”*  
- *“Which sentence is written correctly?”*  
- *“Which sentence shows correct punctuation or structure?”*

Example:  
> *She was tired. She did her homework.*  
> → A) She was tired because she did her homework.  
> → B) Although she was tired, she did her homework. ✅  
> → C) She was tired and although she did her homework.

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Play **“Sentence Mixer”**:
1. Write two simple sentences on slips of paper (e.g. *It was raining.* / *We played inside.*).  
2. Ask your child to join them **three different ways** (using “because”, “so”, “although”).  
3. Discuss how meaning changes — this helps them *feel* grammar structure instead of memorising it!
