# 🧩 Word Forms and Families
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

Words are often part of a **family** — they share a **root word** and change form by adding **prefixes** (at the beginning) or **suffixes** (at the end).

This helps you understand **word meaning**, **spelling**, and **grammar**.

| Part | Function | Example |
|------|-----------|----------|
| **Root Word** | The main part of a word that carries its basic meaning | *act → action, actor, react* |
| **Prefix** | Added **before** the root to change meaning | *unhappy, preview, disappear* |
| **Suffix** | Added **after** the root to change meaning or word type | *kindness, hopeful, teacher* |

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Prefix** | Added before a root word to change meaning | *disagree, undo, impossible* |
| **Suffix** | Added after a root word to change form | *careless, enjoyment, readable* |
| **Root Word** | The basic part of a word without additions | *play → replay, player, playful* |
| **Word Family** | A group of related words with the same root | *happy, unhappy, happiness* |
| **Homophones** | Words that sound the same but have different meanings/spellings | *there, their, they’re* |

## ✏️ Common Prefixes and Meanings

| Prefix | Meaning | Example |
|--------|----------|----------|
| **un-** | not / opposite of | *unfair, unhappy* |
| **dis-** | not / opposite / reverse | *disagree, disconnect* |
| **re-** | again | *replay, rewrite* |
| **pre-** | before | *preview, preheat* |
| **mis-** | wrongly / badly | *misbehave, misunderstand* |
| **in- / im- / il- / ir-** | not | *incorrect, impossible, illegal, irregular* |
| **non-** | not | *nonsense, nonstick* |
| **auto-** | self | *autograph, automatic* |

## ✏️ Common Suffixes and Word Type Changes

| Suffix | Changes to | Example |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **-ness** | noun (from adjective) | *kind → kindness* |
| **-ful** | adjective (adds “full of”) | *hope → hopeful* |
| **-less** | adjective (adds “without”) | *fear → fearless* |
| **-able / -ible** | adjective (adds “can be”) | *read → readable, access → accessible* |
| **-er / -or** | noun (person who does) | *teach → teacher, act → actor* |
| **-ment** | noun (action/result) | *enjoy → enjoyment* |
| **-ly** | adverb (adds “how”) | *quick → quickly* |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- Some prefixes mean the same thing but change spelling for flow:  
  *in-* → *impossible, irregular, illegal.*
- Words ending in “-y” often change to “-i” before a suffix:  
  *happy → happiness, busy → busily.*
- Not all “un-” words mean “not”:  
  *unlock (open)* ≠ *not lock.*
- Homophones can **trick meaning questions** in GL tests:  
  *their (possessive), they’re (they are), there (place).*
