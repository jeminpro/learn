# 🧩 Verb Forms and Tenses
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

A **verb** is a word that shows an **action** (*run, jump, eat*)  
or a **state of being** (*is, seem, become*).

Verbs change their form depending on **when** something happens — this is called **tense**.

There are three main tenses:
| Tense | Time | Example |
|--------|------|----------|
| **Present** | Happening now | *I walk to school.* |
| **Past** | Happened before | *I walked to school.* |
| **Future** | Will happen later | *I will walk to school.* |

Each tense can appear in a **simple**, **progressive (continuous)**, or **perfect** form.

### 🕰️ Verb Forms Table

| Tense | Simple | Progressive (Continuous) | Perfect |
|--------|----------|---------------------------|----------|
| **Present** | *I play football.* | *I am playing football.* | *I have played football.* |
| **Past** | *I played football.* | *I was playing football.* | *I had played football.* |
| **Future** | *I will play football.* | *I will be playing football.* | *I will have played football.* |

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Tense** | Shows the time of the action. | *She eats / She ate / She will eat* |
| **Auxiliary Verb** | “Helper” verb used with main verb (*be, have, do, will*). | *He **is** running.* |
| **Modal Verb** | Expresses possibility or necessity (*can, may, must, should, will, might*). | *You **should** listen.* |
| **Irregular Verb** | Doesn’t follow the normal “-ed” pattern. | *go → went, eat → ate, run → ran* |
| **Subject–Verb Agreement** | Verb matches the subject in number and tense. | *He runs / They run* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Sentence | Explanation |
|-----------|--------------|
| *She walks to school every day.* | Present simple (habit). |
| *She is walking to school right now.* | Present progressive (happening now). |
| *She has walked to school today.* | Present perfect (finished action with effect now). |
| *She was walking when it rained.* | Past progressive (ongoing past action). |
| *She will walk tomorrow.* | Future simple. |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- **Irregular verbs** don’t add “-ed”:  
  *go → went, buy → bought, take → took, eat → ate, run → ran.*
- **Perfect tenses** use “have / had / will have” + *past participle*.  
  *I have eaten, I had eaten, I will have eaten.*
- **Progressive tenses** use “be” + *-ing* form.  
  *I am running, I was running, I will be running.*
- **Avoid mixing tenses** in one sentence.  
  ❌ *I eat breakfast and went to school.*  
  ✅ *I ate breakfast and went to school.*

## 💡 How This Appears in the GL 11+ Exam

GL may ask you to:
- choose the correct verb form:  
  *She (is/was/were) going to school.*
- identify the tense of a given sentence.
- correct a sentence where tenses don’t agree.
- spot an error in subject–verb agreement.

These appear in the **grammar correction** and **proofreading** sections.

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Play a **“Tense Transformer” Game**:
1. Write simple present sentences on cards (e.g., *I walk to school.*).  
2. Ask your child to *transform* each into past, future, progressive, and perfect forms.  
3. Use colour codes or visuals for time shifts (green = now, blue = past, orange = future).  

This helps them *see* how verbs change form — far more engaging than rote memorisation.
