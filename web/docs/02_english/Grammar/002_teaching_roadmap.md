### 🧭 Teaching Notes
- Each “week range” can be adjusted based on pace — you can merge or extend as needed.  
- Keep revisiting **subject–verb agreement**, **tenses**, and **clauses** — these appear most often in GL grammar sections.  
- Encourage reading aloud and sentence correction exercises; these naturally reinforce grammar accuracy.  
- Mix in verbal reasoning grammar-based questions to simulate real GL exam style.
