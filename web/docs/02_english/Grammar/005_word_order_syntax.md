# Word Order and Syntax

---

## 🧠 Explanation

**Word order** means the **arrangement of words** in a sentence so that it makes sense.  
**Syntax** is the **set of rules** that tell us how words fit together correctly in English.

If you change word order, the sentence may sound strange or have a different meaning.

> Example:  
> ✅ *The boy kicked the ball.*  
> ❌ *The ball kicked the boy.*

The same words — but the meaning completely changes because of **syntax** (word order).

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Subject** | The person or thing doing the action. | *The cat* slept. |
| **Verb** | The action or being word. | The cat *slept.* |
| **Object** | The person or thing affected by the action. | The boy kicked *the ball.* |
| **Syntax** | The correct order of words in a sentence. | *Subject → Verb → Object* |
| **Inversion** | When the normal order is flipped, often in questions. | *Are you ready?* instead of *You are ready.* |

## ✏️ Standard English Word Order

| Sentence Type | Structure | Example |
|----------------|------------|----------|
| **Statement** | Subject → Verb → Object | *Tom ate an apple.* |
| **Question** | Auxiliary/Verb → Subject → Rest | *Did Tom eat an apple?* |
| **Command** | Verb at the start | *Eat your dinner.* |
| **Exclamation** | Often starts with *What* or *How* | *What a beautiful day!* |

## 🧩 Examples

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- In English, **word order changes meaning**, unlike some other languages.  
  - *The dog chased the cat* ≠ *The cat chased the dog.*
- **Questions** and **inverted sentences** flip normal order.  
  - *You are late.* → *Are you late?*
- Don’t start sentences with **verbs** unless it’s a command.  
  - ✅ *Run to the gate!* ❌ *Runs to the gate he.*

## 💡 How This Appears in the GL 11+ Exam

You might see:
- *“Which sentence is grammatically correct?”*  
- *“Which sentence makes sense?”*  
- *“Which sentence has correct word order?”*

GL tests this by giving 3–4 sentences that look similar, but only one is correctly structured.

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Play a **“Jumbled Sentence Race”**:
1. Write each word of a sentence on separate cards.  
2. Mix them up and ask your child to arrange them into a correct sentence.  
3. Add a timer for fun — 30 seconds per sentence!  

Then discuss why some orders don’t make sense — this builds instinct for syntax and grammar.
