# 🧩 Voice and Mood
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

In English grammar, **voice** and **mood** describe *how* and *why* a verb is used.

---

### 🎙️ 1. **Voice**
**Voice** tells us whether the subject **does** the action (active) or **receives** it (passive).

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Active Voice** | The subject performs the action. | *The cat chased the mouse.* |
| **Passive Voice** | The subject receives the action. | *The mouse was chased by the cat.* |

- Both sentences mean the same thing, but they focus on different parts.

**How to recognise passive voice:**  
Look for a form of “to be” (*is, was, were, been, being*) + a **past participle** (verb ending in *-ed* or irregular form).  
> *was eaten, is made, were taken, was written.*

---

### 🗣️ 2. **Mood**
**Mood** shows the **purpose or tone** of a sentence — what the writer wants to do.

| Mood | Purpose | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Indicative** | States a fact or asks a question | *He runs fast.* / *Does he run fast?* |
| **Imperative** | Gives a command or instruction | *Close the door.* |
| **Interrogative** | Asks a question | *Are you ready?* |
| **Conditional** | Shows something that might happen if something else happens | *If it rains, we’ll stay inside.* |
| **Subjunctive** (rare) | Expresses a wish or something imagined | *If I were you, I’d study harder.* |

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Active Voice** | Subject does the action | *The chef cooked the meal.* |
| **Passive Voice** | Subject receives the action | *The meal was cooked by the chef.* |
| **Mood** | Tells how the sentence is used (fact, question, command, etc.) | *Sit down.* (imperative) |
| **Conditional Sentence** | Uses *if* to show cause and result | *If you work hard, you will succeed.* |

---

## ✏️ Examples

| Sentence | Voice | Mood | Explanation |
|-----------|--------|------|-------------|
| *The boy kicked the ball.* | Active | Indicative | Statement of fact. |
| *The ball was kicked by the boy.* | Passive | Indicative | Focuses on the ball. |
| *Close the window, please.* | Active | Imperative | Command/request. |
| *If I finish early, I will call you.* | Active | Conditional | Depends on an “if” condition. |
| *If I were taller, I could reach the shelf.* | Active | Subjunctive | Imaginary situation. |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- Avoid mixing **active and passive** forms in one sentence.  
  ❌ *The dog chased and was caught the cat.*  
  ✅ *The dog chased the cat.* / *The cat was caught by the dog.*

- In **passive voice**, the “doer” (agent) can be left out if unimportant.  
  *The window was broken (by someone).*

- The **subjunctive mood** often uses *were* instead of *was* after *if*.  
  ✅ *If I were rich…*  
  ❌ *If I was rich…*

- GL tests often hide these within **proofreading** or **choose-the-correct-sentence** questions.

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Play **“Voice Switch”**:
1. Say a sentence aloud in **active voice** (*The dog chased the cat.*).  
2. Ask your child to change it to **passive** (*The cat was chased by the dog.*).  
3. Then flip again into **different moods**:  
   - Imperative → *Chase the cat!*  
   - Conditional → *If the dog chased the cat, it would bark.*  

This hands-on approach cements both grammar understanding and flexibility — exactly what GL tests expect.
