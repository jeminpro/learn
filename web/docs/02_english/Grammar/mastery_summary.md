## 📗 1. Sentence Structure

- Every sentence needs a **subject** (who/what) and **verb** (action).  
- **Simple** = one clause. **Compound** = two main clauses joined by *and, but, so.*  
- **Complex** = one main + one subordinate clause.  
✅ *The boy ran because he was late.*

---

## 📘 2. Main and Subordinate Clauses

- **Main clause** = full idea.  
- **Subordinate clause** = depends on main clause, begins with *because, when, if, although.*  
✅ *I stayed inside because it was raining.*

---

## 📗 3. Word Order and Syntax

- English uses **Subject → Verb → Object** order.  
✅ *The cat chased the mouse.*  
❌ *Chased the cat the mouse.*  
- In questions, subject and verb switch: *Are you ready?*

## 📘 6. Noun and Pronoun Agreement

- Singular nouns need singular pronouns.

  *The team won its match.*

---

| Adjective | Noun | *A tall building* |
| Adverb | Verb | *He ran quickly* |
- Comparative: *faster, more careful*  
- Superlative: *fastest, most careful*  
- Linking verbs (*is, seem, feel*) take adjectives, not adverbs.

## 📘 8. Voice and Mood

| Reported | Ben said he was tired. | No quotation marks; tense and pronouns change. |

---

## 📘 10. Word Forms and Families

- **Root words** change with prefixes/suffixes.  
  *happy → unhappy → happiness*  
- **Prefix**: added at start → changes meaning (*dis-, un-, pre-*).  
- **Suffix**: added at end → changes form (*-ness, -ful, -ly*).  
- Watch for **homophones** in GL exams:  
  *there / their / they’re.*

2. **Underline the subject and verb** to check agreement.  
3. **Check tense consistency** — GL loves to mix them.  
4. **Circle conjunctions** — make sure clauses fit logically.  
5. **Know your homophones** — they appear in every GL paper.  
6. **Practise 10 minutes daily** with mixed grammar drills — small, consistent bursts beat cramming.  
7. **Revise with examples**, not just rules — GL questions always test meaning in context.
