# 🧩 Main and Subordinate Clauses
*(11+ GL Grammar Masterclass – Gloucestershire)*

---

## 🧠 Explanation

A **clause** is a group of words that has both a **subject** and a **verb**.  
Clauses are the building blocks of sentences.

There are two main types:

| Type | Description | Can it stand alone? | Example |
|------|--------------|--------------------|----------|
| **Main Clause** | Expresses a complete idea. | ✅ Yes | *The boy ran home.* |
| **Subordinate Clause** | Depends on the main clause to make sense. | ❌ No | *because it was raining* |

A **complex sentence** usually has **one main clause** and **one or more subordinate clauses.**

> Example: *The boy ran home **because it was raining.***  
> - Main clause: *The boy ran home.*  
> - Subordinate clause: *because it was raining.*

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Clause** | A group of words with a subject and a verb. | *She sang beautifully.* |
| **Main Clause** | The central idea of the sentence. | *She sang beautifully.* |
| **Subordinate Clause** | Adds extra information; starts with a subordinating conjunction (because, although, if, when, since, etc.). | *because she was happy* |
| **Subordinating Conjunction** | Joins the subordinate clause to the main clause. | *because, although, if, when, since, until* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Sentence | Main Clause | Subordinate Clause |
|-----------|--------------|--------------------|
| *I stayed inside because it was raining.* | I stayed inside | because it was raining |
| *Although she was tired, she finished her homework.* | she finished her homework | Although she was tired |
| *We will go out if the sun shines.* | We will go out | if the sun shines |
| *When the film ended, everyone clapped.* | everyone clapped | When the film ended |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- The **subordinate clause** can come **before or after** the main clause.  
  → *Although it was late, we stayed awake.*  
  → *We stayed awake although it was late.*

- If the subordinate clause comes first, use a **comma** after it.  
  ✅ *When the bell rang, the pupils lined up.*  
  ❌ *When the bell rang the pupils lined up.*

- A subordinate clause **cannot** be a full sentence by itself.  
  ❌ *Because I was hungry.*  
  ✅ *I ate lunch because I was hungry.*

## 💡 How This Appears in the GL 11+ Exam

- GL may ask:
  - *“Which part of this sentence is the subordinate clause?”*
  - *“Which sentence is complete?”*
  - *“Choose the correct joining word.”*
- These questions often appear in:
  - Grammar correction  
  - Sentence completion  
  - Proofreading or comprehension sections

✅ Can write complex sentences correctly

### 💬 Teaching Tip
Turn it into a **“Clause Sorting Game”**:
1. Write clauses on small slips of paper (some main, some subordinate).  
2. Mix them up and ask your child to *pair* a main + subordinate clause to make a full sentence.  
3. Bonus: rearrange the order (subordinate first vs second) and check punctuation.  

This hands-on approach helps them *feel* how clauses connect — far more effective than memorising rules.
