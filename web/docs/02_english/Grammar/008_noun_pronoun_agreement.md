# Noun and Pronoun Agreement

---

## 🧠 Explanation

In English, **nouns** and **pronouns** must **agree** in **number** (singular/plural)  
and **person** (who is speaking or being spoken about).

> Example:  
> ✅ *The boy lost **his** hat.*  
> ❌ *The boy lost **their** hat.*

Here, **boy** is singular, so we use **his**, not **their**.

## 🔑 Key Words to Know

| Term | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Noun** | A person, place, thing, or idea | *dog, city, happiness* |
| **Pronoun** | A word that replaces a noun | *he, she, it, they* |
| **Antecedent** | The noun that a pronoun refers to | *Tom lost **his** pencil.* (Tom = antecedent) |
| **Agreement** | The pronoun matches the noun in number and gender | *The girls took **their** bags.* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Example | Explanation |
|----------|--------------|
| *Each student must bring **his or her** book.* | “Each student” = singular, so pronoun must also be singular. |
| *All the boys brought **their** lunches.* | “Boys” = plural → “their.” |
| *The cat licked **its** paw.* | “Cat” = singular, non-human → “its.” |
| *If a person wants to succeed, **he or she** must try hard.* | “Person” = singular. |
| *The children did their homework before **they** played.* | “Children” → plural → “they.” |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- Words like **everyone, somebody, anyone, each** are **singular**, even though they sound plural.  
  ✅ *Everyone did **his or her** homework.*  
  ❌ *Everyone did **their** homework.* (too informal for GL)
- Don’t switch between singular and plural within the same idea.  
  ❌ *If a person wants to win, they must train hard.*  
  ✅ *If a person wants to win, he or she must train hard.*
- Be careful with **collective nouns**:  
  - *The team lost **its** first game.* (seen as one group)  
  - *The team took **their** seats.* (if thinking of individuals)
- Pronouns must be **clear** — not confusing about whom they refer to.  
  ❌ *When John met Tom, he said hello.* (Who said hello?)
