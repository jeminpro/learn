## 🧩 Key Concepts

| Type | What It Means | Example | Skill Tested |
|------|----------------|----------|---------------|
| **Synonyms** | Words with similar meanings | brave → courageous | Word sense & precision |
| **Antonyms** | Words with opposite meanings | generous → mean | Opposite logic |
| **Closest in Meaning** | Choose the best fit in context | “He was very **keen** to help” → **eager** | Contextual meaning |
| **Odd Meaning Out** | One word doesn’t fit with others | happy, glad, joyful, **angry** | Vocabulary discrimination |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Read Carefully — Find the Core Meaning**
Ignore emotional tone or form — focus on meaning.

> “Rapid” → means quick or fast.  
Find which option has the **same central idea**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Eliminate Clearly Wrong Options**
Cross out any word that’s totally unrelated or wrong in form (noun vs verb).

Example:  
> “Generous” → (kind, mean, polite, grateful)  
Eliminate unrelated words → mean = opposite → ✅ “kind.”

---

### 3️⃣ **Watch for Degree or Intensity**
GL often uses near-synonyms — pick the one **closest in strength**.

> small : tiny :: big : huge  
→ Similar intensity pattern.

---

### 4️⃣ **Use Context for Multiple Meanings**
Some words change meaning in sentences.

> “He broke the record.” (achievement)  
> “She played the record.” (music)  

Read the whole sentence — don’t just match by memory.

---

### 5️⃣ **Prefixes & Suffixes Help**
Use word parts to identify opposites:
- un-, dis-, in-, im-, ir-, non- → usually mean *not*  
- -ful → *full of*  
- -less → *without*  

Example:  
> hopeful ↔ hopeless  
> correct ↔ incorrect

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| **Say the word in your head with each option.** | You’ll “hear” which one fits best. |
| **Look for clear opposites first.** | Faster than testing each synonym. |
| **Learn families of words.** | e.g. brave → courage → courageous → bravery |
| **Read widely — story, news, fact texts.** | Builds natural vocabulary recall. |
| **Don’t overthink intensity.** | Close meaning = accepted in GL. |
