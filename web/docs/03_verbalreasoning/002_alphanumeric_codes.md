# Alphanumeric & Letter–Number Codes
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions use **letters and numbers as codes**.  
You must find the pattern or rule that connects **letters ↔ numbers** and apply it to decode or re-encode another word.

The GL test checks **logical reasoning**, **alphabet knowledge**, and **pattern recognition** — not arithmetic.

## 🧩 Types of Code Questions

| Type | What It Means | Example |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **Letter ↔ Number Codes** | Each letter has a numerical value (A = 1 … Z = 26). | If CAT → 3 1 20, what is DOG? → 4 15 7 |
| **Mixed Letter-Number Codes** | Numbers may follow a hidden rule (e.g. +1, mirror alphabet). | DOG = 4157 → find GOD |
| **Word ↔ Word Codes** | One word is coded using another; match letter positions. | B = 2nd letter etc. |
| **Substitution Codes** | Letters or numbers are replaced by symbols/other letters. | A ↔ Z , B ↔ Y (reverse alphabet) |
| **Alphanumeric Patterns** | Combine letters + numbers logically. | C3 D4 E5 → next = F6 |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Identify the rule**
Look at *every* letter–number pair.

Example 1:  
> CAT = 3 1 20  
A = 1 → matches alphabet position. ✅  
So C = 3, A = 1, T = 20 → **Alphabet positions**.

Example 2:  
> DOG = 4157  
Check if D → 4 and G → 7 = alphabet positions (yes).  
But what’s 1 and 5? Maybe they’re the next letter’s position? Test it!

---

### 2️⃣ **Check if code is direct or reversed**
Some codes use reverse alphabet (A = 26, Z = 1).  
> A Z Y → 26 1 2 (reverse order).

---

### 3️⃣ **Look for consistent gaps**
Sometimes each letter is shifted by a fixed number:
> A → C (+2), B → D (+2).  
Rule = “Add 2”.

Use the same shift on the target word.

---

### 4️⃣ **Apply to new word**
When you know the rule, apply exactly the same pattern.

## ⚡ Quick Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| Write alphabet with numbers underneath: A1 B2 C3 … Z26 | Saves time spotting positions. |
| Check for reverse or +/– shifts quickly. | Most GL codes use ±1–3 shifts. |
| Compare same-position letters across examples. | Reveals the pattern faster. |
| Don’t over-calculate — if 2 pairs fit, test the 3rd. | Confirms your rule. |
| Look for symmetry or repetition. | e.g. A↔Z mirror patterns. |

## 🎯 In the Gloucestershire GL Exam

- Appears under **Verbal Reasoning Section A**.  
- Usually **multiple-choice**: choose the correct code from four options.  
- Each question is independent — no need to remember previous ones.  
- Common variations:
  - “If A = Z and B = Y, what is CAT?”
  - “If DOG = 4157, what is GOD?”
  - “Which of the following has the same code rule as CAT → 312?”

## ✅ Answers & Explanations

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|----|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **A (8 1 20)** | H = 8, A = 1, T = 20. |
| 2 | **A (WLT)** | Reverse alphabet → D (4 → W), O (15 → L), G (7 → T). |
| 3 | **A (31212)** | Rule: each letter = alphabet position minus 1. C (3 − 1 = 2)… apply pattern. |
| 4 | **A (DGCT)** | Shift each letter +2 → B→D, E→G, A→C, R→T. |
| 5 | **A (71154)** | Rule pattern matches positions G 7, O 15, D 4 → GOOD = 7 15 15 4. |

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Play **“Secret Code Challenge”**:
1. Choose a word and invent a simple rule (e.g. +1 shift).  
2. Your child decodes it, explains the rule, and makes the next code for you.  
3. Swap roles — builds logic and speed.
