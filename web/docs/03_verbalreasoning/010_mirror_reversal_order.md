# Mirror / Reversal / Order
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions test how well you can **spot reversed, mirrored, or palindromic patterns** in letters or words.  
They measure visual–verbal reasoning — your ability to imagine how letters or sequences look *backwards or in reverse order.*

They often appear as **word reversals**, **letter mirror matches**, or **palindrome recognition**.

## 🧩 Common Types

| Type | Description | Example | Rule |
|------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Reversed Words** | Word spelled backwards. | STOP → POTS | Reverse letter order |
| **Mirror Letters** | Visually mirrored letters (b ↔ d, p ↔ q). | b ↔ d, p ↔ q | Shape recognition |
| **Palindromes** | Word reads same forwards & backwards. | level, noon, madam | Symmetry |
| **Letter Order Reversal** | Letters or codes appear in reverse order. | ABC : CBA | Reverse sequence |
| **Half-Mirror / Split Reversal** | Two halves mirror each other. | ABBA | Reflection pattern |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **For Reversed Words**
Write the letters in reverse order and check if it forms a real word.

Example:  
> DOG → GOD ✅  
> LOOP → POOL ✅  

Reverse check is enough to identify GL-style reversals quickly.

---

### 2️⃣ **For Mirror Letters**
Some letters look like each other when mirrored:
| Mirror Pairs | Notes |
|---------------|-------|
| b ↔ d | Flip horizontally |
| p ↔ q | Flip horizontally |
| m ↔ w | Flip vertically |
| s ↔ z | May look mirrored in fonts |

If question involves shapes or mirrored text — imagine flipping left-right.

---

### 3️⃣ **For Palindromes**
Read word from both ends. If same both ways → palindrome.

Examples:  
- level ✅  
- noon ✅  
- radar ✅  
- paper ❌  

---

### 4️⃣ **For Reverse Order in Sequences**
If you see a pattern like:  
> ABC, BCA, CAB, CBA, ?  
→ The last one reverses the sequence → apply same reversal.

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| Write quickly — don’t try to visualise everything mentally. | GL gives short time per question. |
| Reverse only if necessary — look for mirror cues (reversed alphabet, letters, or words). | Saves time. |
| Check real-word validity after reversing. | GL usually forms real English words. |
| Know common mirror pairs: b↔d, p↔q, m↔w. | Prevents confusion in visual-matching questions. |
| Palindromes are often even-numbered letters (4–6). | Quick scan helps spot them. |

## 🎯 In Gloucestershire GL Exam

- Appears in **Verbal Reasoning Paper 2**, usually under *word pattern* or *letter order* section.  
- Always **multiple-choice**, often disguised in short word puzzles.  
- Common forms:
  - “Which word is the reverse of another?”  
  - “Which of these pairs are mirror images?”  
  - “Which word reads the same backwards?”  
- May mix with *code or alphabet logic.*

## 🧭 Mastery Checklist

✅ Can identify reversed and mirrored patterns quickly  
✅ Knows common mirror letter pairs  
✅ Recognises palindromes instantly  
✅ Avoids confusing “look-alikes” (e.g. b/d, p/q)

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Try a **“Mirror Minute”** challenge:
1. Write 10 short words (e.g. *part, room, evil, level, stop*).  
2. Give 60 seconds to find which are reversals or palindromes.  
3. Bonus: have them write each in reverse order correctly.  

This builds **visual–verbal awareness** and **speed spotting** for GL reasoning puzzles.
