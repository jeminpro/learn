### 🧭 Teaching Notes
- GL verbal reasoning for Gloucestershire uses **multiple-choice** format with **timed sections**.  
- Vocabulary strength and reading comprehension are critical — even “logic” VR questions depend on word meaning.  
- Regularly rotate between **word meaning**, **patterns**, and **codes** to mirror the balance in the real test.  
- Each grammar school uses the same shared GL test across the county.
