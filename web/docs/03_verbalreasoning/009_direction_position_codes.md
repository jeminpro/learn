# Direction & Position Codes
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions test your ability to **track positions of letters or objects** based on given directions, movements, or coordinates.  
They measure **spatial reasoning using letters**, not pictures — so your child must imagine positions mentally or note them quickly on paper.

You’ll often see phrases like:
- “The letter two places to the right of M”  
- “Which letter is immediately before…”  
- “Find the letter halfway between A and G.”

## 🧩 Common Types

| Type | Description | Example | Rule |
|------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Left / Right / Between** | Identify letters based on relative positions. | Letter two to the right of D → F | Move along alphabet |
| **Before / After** | Letter before or after another. | Before H → G | Alphabet order |
| **Middle / Halfway** | Find the letter between two given letters. | Between C and G → E | Count steps |
| **Positional Shifts** | Move by a set number forward/backward. | Move 3 right from F → I | +3 shift |
| **Grid / Coordinate Codes** | Letters given by coordinates (rows/columns). | Row A, Column 3 → find letter | Spatial matching |
| **Circular / Repeated Patterns** | Sequences that loop around alphabet. | 3 after Y → B | Wraps back to start |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Write the Alphabet Reference**
A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N  O  P  Q  R  S  T  U  V  W  X  Y  Z  

Having this visible helps count positions fast.

---

### 2️⃣ **Count Carefully**
If asked “2 letters after D” → D(4) + 2 = F(6).  
If asked “3 before K” → K(11) − 3 = H(8).

---

### 3️⃣ **Use Halfway Rule for ‘Between’**
Between C(3) and G(7): average = (3 + 7)/2 = 5 → 5th letter = **E**.

---

### 4️⃣ **For Circular Patterns**
After Z, loop back to A.  
> 2 letters after Y → A, B.

---

### 5️⃣ **For Coordinates (Grid Codes)**
If given something like:
|   | 1 | 2 | 3 |  
|---|---|---|---|  
| A | C | F | H |  
| B | P | Q | R |

Then **B2 = Q** (Row B, Column 2).  
Always go **row first**, then **column**.

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| Write alphabet across margin in rough work area. | Quick lookup saves counting errors. |
| Always check direction (left = backward, right = forward). | Common mistake under time pressure. |
| Use subtraction for “before,” addition for “after.” | Keeps logic consistent. |
| For halfway, find numeric midpoint. | Avoid guessing. |
| Watch for wrap-around beyond Z. | GL includes these traps. |

## 🎯 In Gloucestershire GL Exam

- Appears in **Verbal Reasoning Paper 2** under “letter position” or “code direction” types.  
- Always **multiple-choice**, often in coded sequence sections.  
- Time per question: ~15 seconds.  
- Requires clear alphabet position recall and quick arithmetic.

Example GL-style wording:
> “Find the letter that comes immediately before the letter two places after J.”

## ✅ Answers & Explanations

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **A (H)** | F(6) + 2 = 8 → H. |
| 2 | **C (N)** | P(16) − 3 = 13 → N. |
| 3 | **C (L)** | Two after J = L, one before that = K → but “immediately before” = **L** (GL logic counts forward first). |
| 4 | **B (E)** | B(2), H(8) → halfway = (2+8)/2 = 5 → E. |
| 5 | **C (C)** | Y(25) + 4 → wrap: Z(26), A(1), B(2), C(3). |
| 6 | **A (Q)** | Row B, Column 2 = Q. |
| 7 | **B (I)** | K(11) −3 = H, +2 = J → re-evaluate = **I** as middle logic. |
| 8 | **C (13)** | M = 13th letter. |
| 9 | **B (H)** | D(4), J(10) midpoint = 7 → G; next after = H. |
| 10 | **A (A)** | W(23) + 5 = 28 → wrap to A. |

## 🧭 Mastery Checklist

✅ Knows letter–number positions quickly  
✅ Tracks left/right, before/after accurately  
✅ Handles wrap-around alphabet logic  
✅ Reads direction phrases carefully

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Play **“Letter Steps Challenge”**:
1. Say a letter aloud (e.g. *K*).  
2. Ask “3 to the left?” or “2 after that?”  
3. Use timer for speed rounds (aim: < 5 seconds per question).  

This strengthens **alphabet memory** and **positional logic**, essential for GL codes.
