# LCM (Least Common Multiple)

The **LCM** of two or more numbers is the **smallest number** that is a multiple of all the numbers.

> Think of LCM as the first time two different "skip counting" lines meet.

### 🧮 Example:

Find LCM of **4** and **6**

* Multiples of 4: 4, 8, **12**, 16, 20, 24
* Multiples of 6: 6, **12**, 18, 24, 30
  ✅ First common = **12**

### 🧩 Word Problem Example:

#### 📝 Example 3:

**"A school bell rings every 4 minutes. Another rings every 6 minutes. If they both just rang now, in how many minutes will they ring together again?"**

🧠 You're being asked: *What’s the least common time?* → **LCM of 4 and 6**
✅ Answer = **12 minutes**
