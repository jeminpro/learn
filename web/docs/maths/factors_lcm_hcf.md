# Factors HCF LCM

Let‚Äôs explore **Factors**, **HCF**, and **LCM** in **great detail**, along with **step-by-step examples**, **questions**, and **how they appear in word problems** ‚Äî especially useful for **upper primary**, **11 Plus**, and **everyday problem solving**.

---

## üîπ 1. **Factors** ‚Äì The Building Blocks of Numbers

### ‚úÖ What is a Factor?

A **factor** is a **whole number** that divides another number **exactly**, leaving no remainder.

> Think of factors as ‚Äúperfect pieces‚Äù that fit evenly into the number.

### üßÆ Examples:

* Factors of **12**:
  1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
  ‚úÖ Because:

  * 12 √∑ 1 = 12
  * 12 √∑ 2 = 6
  * 12 √∑ 3 = 4
  * 12 √∑ 4 = 3
  * 12 √∑ 6 = 2
  * 12 √∑ 12 = 1

### ‚ùì Practice Questions:

1. What are the factors of 18?
2. Which of these numbers are factors of 24: 3, 5, 8, 12?
3. True or False: 7 is a factor of 49.

---

### üß© How are Factors Used in Word Problems?

#### üìù Example 1:

**"There are 24 apples. You want to divide them equally among your friends. How many ways can you do that without cutting any apple?"**

üß† You're being asked: *What numbers divide 24 exactly?* ‚Üí **Factors of 24**
‚úÖ Answers: You can divide them among 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, or 24 friends.

---

## üîπ 2. **HCF (Highest Common Factor)** ‚Äì The Greatest "Even Divider"

### ‚úÖ What is HCF?

The **HCF** of two or more numbers is the **largest number** that can divide all of them **without remainder**.

### üí° Why Useful?

When you want to divide or simplify **something equally**, like portions or groups.

### üßÆ Example:

Find the HCF of **12** and **18**

* Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
* Factors of 18: 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
  ‚úÖ Common: 1, 2, 3, 6 ‚Üí **HCF = 6**

---

### üß© Word Problem Example:

#### üìù Example 2:

**"Ali has 12 pencils and 18 pens. He wants to group them into identical sets with no leftovers. What is the greatest number of identical sets he can make?"**

üß† You're being asked: *What's the greatest number that divides both 12 and 18?* ‚Üí **HCF**

‚úÖ HCF = 6
‚Üí He can make **6 sets**, each with 2 pencils and 3 pens.

---

### ‚ùì Practice Questions:

1. Find the HCF of 15 and 20.
2. What is the HCF of 16, 24, and 32?
3. Sam has 30 red and 45 blue marbles. What‚Äôs the largest number of identical bags he can make without mixing colors?

---

## üîπ 3. **LCM (Least Common Multiple)** ‚Äì The First Number They Share

### ‚úÖ What is LCM?

The **LCM** of two or more numbers is the **smallest number** that is a multiple of all the numbers.

> Think of LCM as the first time two different "skip counting" lines meet.

### üßÆ Example:

Find LCM of **4** and **6**

* Multiples of 4: 4, 8, **12**, 16, 20, 24
* Multiples of 6: 6, **12**, 18, 24, 30
  ‚úÖ First common = **12**

---

### üß© Word Problem Example:

#### üìù Example 3:

**"A school bell rings every 4 minutes. Another rings every 6 minutes. If they both just rang now, in how many minutes will they ring together again?"**

üß† You're being asked: *What‚Äôs the least common time?* ‚Üí **LCM of 4 and 6**
‚úÖ Answer = **12 minutes**

---

### ‚ùì Practice Questions:

1. Find the LCM of 5 and 7.
2. Two children skip rope every 8 and 12 seconds. When will they skip together next?
3. LCM of 9, 12, and 18?
