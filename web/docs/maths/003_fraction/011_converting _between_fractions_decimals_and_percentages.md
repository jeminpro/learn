# Converting Between Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

Fractions, decimals, and percentages are **three ways of showing parts of a whole**.

They’re all connected:

* **Fraction → Decimal**: Divide the numerator by the denominator
* **Decimal → Percentage**: Multiply by 100
* **Fraction → Percentage**: First convert to a decimal, then to a percentage
* **Percentage → Fraction**: Write over 100, then simplify
* **Percentage → Decimal**: Divide by 100
* **Decimal → Fraction**: Say the number out loud and simplify
