# Understanding Fractions

A **fraction** is a way of showing a part of something. Think of a fraction as a pizza that’s been sliced up.

* The **top number** (called the **numerator**) tells us **how many parts we have**.
* The **bottom number** (called the **denominator**) tells us **how many equal parts the whole is split into**.

Example:
In ¾, the **3** means we have 3 parts, and the **4** means the whole is split into 4 parts. So ¾ is **3 out of 4 equal parts**.

### 🎨 Visual Metaphor:

Imagine a chocolate bar split into 8 pieces. If you eat 5, you’ve eaten ⁵⁄₈ of it!

### 🧠 Key Ideas:

* Fractions are about **equal parts**.
* Every whole number can be written as a fraction. (Example: 1 = 2/2 or 3/3)
* Fractions can be **proper** (less than 1) like 3/4 or **improper** (more than 1) like 7/4.
* An **improper fraction** can also be written as a **mixed number**. (Example: 7/4 = 1¾)

### 🧮 Examples:

1. 🍕 A pizza is cut into 6 slices. You eat 2. What fraction did you eat? → 2/6
2. 🧃 A juice bottle is filled up to 3/5. What part is empty? → 2/5
3. 🧩 Write 1 whole as a fraction with 4 as the denominator. → 4/4
4. 🍫 You eat 1 and ½ chocolate bars. Write this as a fraction. → 3/2
5. 🥧 Shade ¾ of a rectangle split into 4 equal parts → Shade 3 parts

💡 **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

* Don’t confuse numerator and denominator.
* Fractions must be of **equal parts** — 2 out of 5 *unequal* slices isn't 2/5!
