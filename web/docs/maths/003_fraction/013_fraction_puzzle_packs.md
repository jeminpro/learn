## ✅ Answers

### Puzzle 1 (one possible solution):

|   | A   | B   | C   | Sum |
| - | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 1/2 | 1/3 | 1/6 | 1   |

### Puzzle 2:

* 🍌 Bananas → 2/3 of 18 = 12 → B
* 🍊 Oranges → 3/4 of 20 = 15 → A
* 🍎 Apples → 5/6 of 12 = 10 → C

### Puzzle 3:

* Amy: 1/2 (more than Chloe)
* Ben: 1/3
* Chloe: 1/6

### Puzzle 4:

1. ✅ True
2. ✅ True
3. ❌ (1/4 + 1/8 = 3/8)
4. ❌ (3/5 − 1/10 = 5/10 = 1/2)
5. ✅ True
6. ✅ True
7. ✅ 3/4 × 32 = 24
8. ❌ 0.25 = 1/4

### Puzzle 5:

* Denominator: Multiple of 6, not 12 → 6 or 18
* Numerator = 1/2 of denominator
* So: **3/6 = 1/2 (not in simplest form)** ❌
* Try 9/18 → not simplest ❌
* Try **4/8 = 1/2** ❌
* **Final answer: 5/10 = 1/2** ❌ (10 is not multiple of 6)

✅ Correct answer: **3/6**, but not in simplest form → **None**
Let’s adjust: Try **2/4 → no**,
**1/2 is simplest, but 2/4 = 1/2**

Let’s go with: **3/6 → not simplest**
Better: **Answer is 2/4, but simplified → 1/2**

🟢 Final valid answer: **1/2**
