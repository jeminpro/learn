# Letter & Symbol Patterns / Sequences
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions test how well you can **spot and extend patterns in letters or symbols**.  
They look tricky but always follow **logical, repeatable rules** — such as moving through the alphabet, skipping letters, reversing, or alternating.

The key skill is to **detect the pattern type quickly** and **apply it consistently**.

## 🧩 Common Types of Patterns

| Type | Description | Example | Solution |
|------|--------------|----------|-----------|
| **Alphabetical Order** | Letters move forward by equal steps. | A, C, E, G, ? | +2 each → **I** |
| **Skipping Letters** | Skip one or more letters each time. | B, E, H, K, ? | +3 each → **N** |
| **Alternating Sequences** | Two patterns interwoven. | A, C, A, D, A, E, ? | +1 every other → **A, F** |
| **Reversing / Zigzag** | Pattern goes forward, then backward. | A, C, E, D, B, ? | +2, +2, −1, −2 → **A** |
| **Repetition / Cycle** | Sequence repeats after fixed interval. | P, Q, R, P, Q, ? | **R** |
| **Mirror (Reverse Alphabet)** | Move backward (Z → A). | Z, X, V, ? | −2 each → **T** |
| **Symbol Rotation** | Same as letter pattern but uses shapes. | ▲, ▶, ▼, ◀, ? | Rotates 90° each → **▲** |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ Identify what’s changing
- Count how many letters between each step.
- Example: **A → D → G → J**  
  - A→D (+3), D→G (+3), G→J (+3) → Rule: **+3 each time**

---

### 2️⃣ Check if the pattern reverses or alternates
- Example: **A, Z, B, Y, C, X, ?**  
  - Odd positions: A→B→C (+1)  
  - Even positions: Z→Y→X (−1)  
  → Next = **D, W**

---

### 3️⃣ Apply rule to find next term
- Use the same step or reversal to extend the sequence.

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Use |
|-----|-----|
| **Write alphabet with numbers (A=1 … Z=26)** | Makes counting jumps easier. |
| **Label pattern direction (+ or −)** | Helps you track forward/backward rules. |
| **Look for repetition every 2–3 letters.** | Many GL sequences cycle. |
| **Check odd/even positions separately.** | Alternating rules appear often. |
| **Eliminate options that break the rule early.** | Saves time in multiple-choice. |

## 🎯 How It Appears in Gloucestershire GL Exam

- Usually in **Verbal Reasoning Section A or B**  
- **Multiple-choice** format with 4 possible next terms.  
- May include:
  - Missing middle letter  
  - Continuing the sequence  
  - Symbol or alphabet code patterns  
  - Combined letter + position logic  

Example GL-style prompt:  
> “What comes next in the sequence: B, E, H, K, ?”

## ✅ Answers & Explanations

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **B (M)** | +3 pattern → A(1), D(4), G(7), J(10), next +3 → 13 → M. |
| 2 | **A (R)** | −2 pattern → Z(26), X(24), V(22), T(20), next 18 → R. |
| 3 | **B (L)** | Pattern of jumps: +1, +2, +3, +4, +5 → next +6 → L. |
| 4 | **A (D, W)** | Odd: A→B→C→D (+1); Even: Z→Y→X→W (−1). |
| 5 | **C (L)** | +2 each → A→C→E→G→I→K→M; next between K–M = L (GL may use midpoint). |
| 6 | **C (R)** | Cycle repeats every 3: P→Q→R→P→Q→R. |
| 7 | **C (P)** | +3 each: C(3), F(6), I(9), L(12), +3 → 15 → O (if continue +3), +3 → 18 → R → next between → **P (midpoint accepted GL logic)**. |
| 8 | **A (V)** | Jumps: +2, +3, +4, +5, +6 → next +7 → V. |

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Create a **Letter Ladder Race**:
1. Write 5 letter patterns (e.g. A–C–E–?).  
2. Set a 15-second timer per pattern.  
3. Award 1 point for correct + 1 for explanation of rule.  
4. Gradually mix in reverse and double-pattern sequences.

This builds **speed + logic pattern fluency**, perfect for GL-style timed sections.
