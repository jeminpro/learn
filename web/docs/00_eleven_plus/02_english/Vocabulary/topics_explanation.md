## 🧠 Overview
Vocabulary in the Gloucestershire GL 11+ exam checks how well students **understand, compare, and use words in context** — not just memorise meanings.  

It includes:
- Knowing word meanings (synonyms & antonyms)
- Spotting relationships between words
- Understanding word formation (prefixes, suffixes, roots)
- Recognising spelling, usage, and homophone traps

**Example:**  
| Word | Synonyms |

| big | large, huge, enormous, gigantic |

**In the GL exam:**  
- “Which word means the same as *brave*?”

**Tip:**  
Learn *shades of meaning* — e.g. *angry* ≠ *furious* (stronger emotion).

**In the GL exam:**  
“Which word is the opposite of *honest*?”
