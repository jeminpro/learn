# ⚓ Commas

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Commas are the **“breathing marks”** of writing — they separate ideas, list items, and guide how sentences sound when read aloud.  
Used well, they make meaning clear; used wrongly, they cause confusion or *comma splices*.

---

## 🧩 1. The Six Main Uses of Commas

---

### **1️⃣ Lists**
Separate items in a simple list.

✅ *Example:*  
> We bought apples, bananas, pears and grapes.

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> We bought apples bananas pears and grapes.

💡 *Note:* British English rarely uses a comma before *and* in simple lists (the Oxford comma), unless needed for clarity.

> We invited the clowns, the dancers, and the acrobats. (✅ only if confusion possible)

---

### **2️⃣ Co-ordinate Adjectives**
Use commas between adjectives that **equally describe** a noun.  
Test: Can you add *and* or switch order?

✅ *Examples:*  
> It was a long, tiring journey.  
> A cold, damp morning greeted us.

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> Three, large dogs chased us. ❌ (number + description don’t coordinate)

---

### **3️⃣ Fronted Adverbials**
Add a comma after an opening phrase or word that tells **when, where, or how** something happens.

✅ *Examples:*  
> After dinner, we went for a walk.  
> In the distance, thunder rumbled.  
> Quickly, she hid the letter.

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> After dinner we went for a walk ❌ (missing pause for clarity)

---

### **4️⃣ Direct Address**
Use commas to separate **who** is being spoken to.

✅ *Examples:*  
> Come here, James.  
> Lily, can you pass the salt?  
> Be quiet, everyone!

🚫 *Wrong:*  
> Come here James. (changes meaning!)

---

### **5️⃣ Extra Information (Non-essential Clauses or Appositives)**
Commas go **around** extra information that could be removed without changing the main meaning.

✅ *Examples:*  
> My brother, a brilliant swimmer, won the race.  
> London, the capital of England, is very busy.

If the information is **essential** (identifies *which one*), do **not** use commas.

> The boy who wore the red hat won. ✅ (needed info, no commas)

---

### **6️⃣ Introductory or Linking Phrases**
Use commas after connectors or transition words introducing sentences.

✅ *Examples:*  
> However, we decided to stay home.  
> Therefore, the plan was cancelled.  
> In fact, nobody noticed.

## ⚠️ 2. Common Traps & 11+ Pitfalls

---

### ❌ **Comma Splice**
Two complete sentences joined only by a comma — incorrect!

> It was late, we went home. ❌  
✅ Fix it with:
- a full stop → *It was late. We went home.*  
- a joining word → *It was late, so we went home.*  
- a semicolon → *It was late; we went home.*

---

### ❌ **Random Commas**
Don’t insert commas wherever you pause in speech.  
They must follow **grammatical rules**, not just breathing patterns.

> The teacher, gave us homework. ❌

---

### ❌ **Missing Commas in Fronted Phrases**
> Before the match the coach spoke. ❌  
> Before the match, the coach spoke. ✅

---

### ❌ **Missing Commas in Direct Address**
> Sit down Ben. ❌ → Sit down, Ben. ✅

---

### ❌ **Confusing Meaning**
Commas can **change** meaning entirely:

> Let’s eat, Grandma. ✅  
> Let’s eat Grandma. ❌

## 🧠 3. Teaching Tips

- **Use sticky notes** for each rule — let your child match examples to the correct rule card.  
- Read aloud with exaggerated pauses; let your child *hear* when a comma helps.  
- Use **comma surgery**: hand over a messy paragraph and ask them to “operate” by inserting commas correctly.  
- Compare before/after versions to show how commas control meaning.

| Rule | Purpose | Example | Trap |
|------|----------|----------|------|
| **List** | Separate items | We saw lions, tigers and bears. | Oxford comma confusion |
| **Adjectives** | Between equal adjectives | A bright, sunny day. | No comma between number + adjective |
| **Fronted Adverbial** | Mark opening phrase | After lunch, we left. | Missing comma after opener |
| **Direct Address** | Separate speaker/reader | Hurry up, Tom! | Meaning changes if missing |
| **Extra Info** | Add removable detail | My sister, a nurse, arrived. | Don’t use when info is essential |
| **Introductory Words** | After connectors | However, we stayed. | Forgetting comma after “However” |
