# Parts of Speech

## 🧠 Explanation

Every word in English belongs to a **word family** called a **part of speech**.  
Knowing the parts of speech helps you understand how sentences work and how to fix grammar mistakes in the GL exam.

There are **8 main parts of speech**.

| Part of Speech | What It Does | Example Sentence |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- **Adjectives vs Adverbs:**  
  - Adjectives describe *nouns* → *The quick fox.*  
  - Adverbs describe *verbs* → *The fox ran quickly.*  
  ❌ *He ran quick.* → ✅ *He ran quickly.*

- **Prepositions** can look small but matter a lot!  
  - *in, on, under, by, between, after, during, before, with*

- **Conjunctions** change sentence structure:  
  - *I wanted to go, but it was raining.*  
  - *Although it was raining, I wanted to go.*

## 💡 How This Appears in the GL 11+ Exam

GL may test this by asking:
- *“Which word is a noun/adverb/etc. in this sentence?”*  
- *“Choose the correct word to complete the sentence.”*  
- *“Which sentence is grammatically correct?”*

Parts of speech are also hidden inside **proofreading** and **sentence correction** sections.
