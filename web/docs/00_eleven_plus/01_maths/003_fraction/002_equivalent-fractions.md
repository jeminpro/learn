# Equivalent Fractions

**Equivalent fractions** are different fractions that show the same amount.

Imagine a pizza:

* If you eat **½** of a pizza, it’s the same as eating **2/4** or **4/8** — you’re just slicing the pizza differently!

### 🔍 Visual Metaphor:

Picture a chocolate bar:

* Break it into 2 pieces and eat 1 → ½
* Now break the same bar into 4 pieces and eat 2 → 2/4
* It looks different, but it’s the **same amount** eaten!

### 🔢 How to Find Equivalent Fractions:

You can multiply (or divide) the **numerator and denominator by the same number**.

> Example:
> 1/2 = (1×2)/(2×2) = 2/4
> 1/2 = (1×5)/(2×5) = 5/10

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* You can’t just multiply or divide **one part** of the fraction (just the top or bottom).
  That changes the value!

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Are 3/6 and 1/2 equivalent?
   → Yes, 3 ÷ 3 = 1 and 6 ÷ 3 = 2 → 3/6 = 1/2

2. Write two equivalent fractions to 2/3:
   → 4/6 and 6/9 (Multiply top and bottom by 2 and 3)

3. Is 5/10 the same as 1/2?
   → Yes, divide both top and bottom by 5.

4. Find an equivalent of ¾ with denominator 12:
   → Multiply both by 3 → 9/12

5. Circle the pairs that are equivalent:
   a) 1/3 and 2/6 ✔️
   b) 3/4 and 6/9 ✖️
   c) 2/5 and 6/15 ✔️
