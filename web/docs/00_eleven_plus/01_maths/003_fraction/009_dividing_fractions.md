# Dividing Fractions

### 📘 Explanation:

To **divide fractions**, we flip the second fraction and **multiply**.
This is known as **"multiply by the reciprocal."**

> **Reciprocal** means flipping a fraction.
> Example: The reciprocal of 2/3 is **3/2**

### 🧠 Steps to Divide Fractions:

1. **Keep** the first fraction as it is.
2. **Flip** the second fraction (find the reciprocal).
3. **Multiply** the two fractions.
4. **Simplify** if needed.

> Example:
> 2/3 ÷ 4/5
> → 2/3 × 5/4 = 10/12 = **5/6**

### 🔢 Dividing by Whole Numbers

Write the whole number as a fraction over 1, then follow the same rule.

> Example:
> 3/4 ÷ 2 = 3/4 ÷ 2/1 = 3/4 × 1/2 = **3/8**

### 🍕 Real-Life Analogy:

You have **2/3 of a pizza** and want to split it evenly between **2 people**.
You do:
**2/3 ÷ 2 = 1/3** — each person gets **1/3 of the whole pizza**.

---

### 🧮 Examples:

1. 1/2 ÷ 1/4 → 1/2 × 4/1 = **4/2 = 2**
2. 3/5 ÷ 1/2 → 3/5 × 2/1 = **6/5 = 1 1/5**
3. 4 ÷ 1/2 = 4/1 × 2/1 = **8**
4. 3/4 ÷ 3 = 3/4 × 1/3 = **1/4**
5. 5/6 ÷ 2/3 → 5/6 × 3/2 = **15/12 = 1 1/4**
