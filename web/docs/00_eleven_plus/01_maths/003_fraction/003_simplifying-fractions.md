# Simplifying Fractions

**Simplifying a fraction** means rewriting it using the **smallest numbers possible** while keeping the value the same. It’s like shrinking a fraction to its **most reduced form**.

### 🍕 Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine cutting a pizza into 8 equal slices and eating 4. You can say:

* “I ate 4 out of 8 slices” → 4/8
* But we know 4/8 is the same as **½**.

So, **½ is the simplified version** of 4/8.

### 🧠 How to Simplify:

1. **Find the greatest number** that divides both the numerator and denominator (called the **GCD** or **HCF**).
2. Divide both top and bottom by that number.

> Example:
> Simplify 6/9
> GCD of 6 and 9 = 3
> → 6 ÷ 3 = 2, 9 ÷ 3 = 3
> So, 6/9 = **2/3**

### 🧊 Tip:

If you divide the numerator and denominator by the same number, you are keeping the **value** the same — just writing it more simply.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Simplify 12/16
   → GCD = 4 → 12 ÷ 4 = 3, 16 ÷ 4 = 4 → Answer: **3/4**

2. Simplify 10/25
   → GCD = 5 → 2/5

3. Simplify 14/21
   → GCD = 7 → 2/3

4. Simplify 9/12
   → GCD = 3 → 3/4

5. Simplify 100/120
   → GCD = 20 → 5/6
