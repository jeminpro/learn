# Subtracting Fractions

**Subtracting fractions** is very similar to adding them. But instead of combining, weâ€™re finding the **difference between two parts**.

Just like with addition, you need to have the **same denominator** to subtract properly.

### ðŸ§  Steps to Subtract Fractions:

#### âœ… Case 1: Same Denominator

Subtract the numerators. Keep the denominator the same.

> Example:
> 5/8 âˆ’ 2/8 = (5 âˆ’ 2)/8 = **3/8**

#### âœ… Case 2: Different Denominators

1. **Find a common denominator**
2. **Convert both fractions** to have that denominator
3. **Subtract the numerators**
4. Simplify if needed

> Example:
> 3/4 âˆ’ 1/3 â†’ LCM of 4 and 3 = 12
> â†’ 9/12 âˆ’ 4/12 = 5/12

### ðŸ§  Special Cases:

* If the result is **0**, that means the parts were equal (e.g. 2/5 âˆ’ 2/5 = 0)
* If the first fraction is **smaller**, the result is a **negative number**, but we avoid those in primary-level problems
* Answers can be **proper**, **improper**, or **mixed numbers**

### ðŸ§® Examples:

1. 6/9 âˆ’ 2/9 = 4/9
2. 4/5 âˆ’ 3/5 = 1/5
3. 7/8 âˆ’ 3/8 = 4/8 = **1/2**
4. 5/6 âˆ’ 1/2 â†’ 10/12 âˆ’ 6/12 = **4/12 = 1/3**
5. 3/4 âˆ’ 2/3 â†’ 9/12 âˆ’ 8/12 = **1/12**
