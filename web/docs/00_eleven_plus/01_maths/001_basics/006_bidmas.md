# BIDMAS

### 📘 Understanding BIDMAS and Why Order Matters:

When we do maths, **the order we solve things in** changes the answer.
That’s why we follow **BIDMAS**, which stands for:

**B** – Brackets
**I** – Indices (powers or square numbers)
**D** – Division
**M** – Multiplication
**A** – Addition
**S** – Subtraction

Think of BIDMAS like **a queue in a café** — whoever comes first in the queue gets served first.
So, in maths, brackets are first in line, followed by powers, then division and multiplication, and finally addition and subtraction.

To help you remember:
👉 *“Brackets Inside, Division-Multiplication, Add-Subtract.”*

Or use a fun saying:
🍰 *“Big Ice-cream Desserts Make Anyone Smile.”*

### Step-by-Step Thinking:

1. **Look for brackets** — Solve what’s inside them first.
2. **Look for powers or squares** — Like 4² = 16.
3. **Do division and multiplication** — Work from **left to right**.
4. **Do addition and subtraction** — Also **left to right**.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes:

* **Doing addition before multiplication:**
  Wrong: 3 + 4 × 2 = 14 (if done left to right)
  Right: 3 + (4 × 2) = 11
* **Ignoring brackets:**
  Brackets change everything — 2 + (3 × 4) is **14**, but (2 + 3) × 4 is **20**.
* **Forgetting left-to-right rule** for division and multiplication — they are equal in rank, so do whichever comes first in the question.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Example 1**
   3 + 4 × 2
   Step 1: Multiply first → 4 × 2 = 8
   Step 2: Add → 3 + 8 = **11**

2. **Example 2**
   (5 + 3) × 2
   Step 1: Brackets first → 5 + 3 = 8
   Step 2: Multiply → 8 × 2 = **16**

3. **Example 3**
   10 − 6 ÷ 3
   Step 1: Divide first → 6 ÷ 3 = 2
   Step 2: Subtract → 10 − 2 = **8**

4. **Example 4**
   4 × (3 + 2)²
   Step 1: Inside brackets → 3 + 2 = 5
   Step 2: Indices → 5² = 25
   Step 3: Multiply → 4 × 25 = **100**

5. **Example 5 (with multiple operations)**
   12 ÷ (2 × 3) + 4
   Step 1: Inside brackets → 2 × 3 = 6
   Step 2: Divide → 12 ÷ 6 = 2
   Step 3: Add → 2 + 4 = **6**
