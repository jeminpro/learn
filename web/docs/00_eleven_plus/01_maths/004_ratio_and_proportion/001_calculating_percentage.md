# Calculating Percentages

### 📘 Explanation:

**What is a percentage?**
A **percentage** tells us how many parts out of 100 something is.
For example:

* 60% = 60 out of 100
* 25% = one quarter (¼)
* 10% = one tenth

Percentages are just another way to write **fractions** or **decimals**:

| Fraction | Decimal | Percent |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| ½        | 0.5     | 50%     |
| ¼        | 0.25    | 25%     |
| ⅕        | 0.2     | 20%     |
| ¾        | 0.75    | 75%     |

### 💡 The Three Golden Methods

1. **Find percentage of a number**
   Percentage of a number = (Percent / 100) × Whole
   Example: 25% of 80 = (25 ÷ 100) × 80 = 20.

2. **Find what percent one number is of another**
   Percent = (Part / Whole) × 100
   Example: 12 is what percent of 40?
   → (12 ÷ 40) × 100 = 30%.

3. **Increase or decrease by a percentage**

    * Increase:
       New amount = Original × (1 + Percent / 100)
    * Decrease:
       New amount = Original × (1 - Percent / 100)
    Example: Increase £60 by 20% → 60 × 1.2 = £72
   Example: Increase £60 by 20% → 60 × 1.2 = £72
   Decrease £60 by 20% → 60 × 0.8 = £48

### 🧠 Quick Tricks & Visuals

* **10%** = divide by 10
* **5%** = half of 10%
* **1%** = divide by 100
* To find **15%**, find 10% + 5%.
* For **12.5%**, halve twice (that’s ⅛).

**Everyday Visuals**
Think of a **bar of chocolate with 100 squares** — if you shade 25, you’ve shaded 25%.
Or if a £100 bill is divided into parts, 20% means £20.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes

| Mistake                                          | Correct Thinking                                         |
| ------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Dividing by 100 twice                            | Divide by 100 only once.                                 |
| Forgetting to multiply the percent by the number | Always find the fraction of the whole.                   |
| Mixing up increase vs. decrease                  | “Increase” adds to 100%, “decrease” subtracts from 100%. |
| Using wrong whole                                | Always identify what the 100% refers to.                 |

### 🧮 Examples:

1️⃣ **Find a simple percentage:**
25% of 80 = ¼ of 80 = **20**

2️⃣ **Find a tricky percentage using steps:**
15% of 120 = 10% (12) + 5% (6) = **18**

3️⃣ **Find a percent of a smaller number:**
40% of 50 = 0.4 × 50 = **20**

4️⃣ **Increase by a percent:**
Increase 200 by 25% = 200 × 1.25 = **250**

5️⃣ **Find what percent one number is of another:**
12 is what percent of 48?
12 ÷ 48 = 0.25 → 25%

6️⃣ **Decrease by a percent:**
Decrease 90 by 10% = 90 × 0.9 = **81**

>
> * Start with **visual grids or 100 squares** to link percentages to fractions.
> * Practise **mental shortcuts** (10%, 5%, 1%).
> * Gradually move to **two-step problems** (find percent → add/subtract).
> * Introduce **reverse percentages** (e.g., find original price) with clear language: “This is *after* the discount.”
> * In timed tests, encourage quick estimation — if 20% of £50 = £10, then 25% ≈ £12.50.
