# Converting decimals and fractions

### 📘 Explanation:

**Big idea:**
Fractions and decimals are **two ways of showing parts of a whole**.
They mean the same thing — they’re just written differently.
For example:

* 1/2 = 0.5
* 1/4 = 0.25
* 3/10 = 0.3

### 🧩 How to convert **fractions → decimals**

#### Method 1: When the denominator is 10, 100, or 1000

Just read it as “tenths”, “hundredths”, or “thousandths”.

| Fraction | Meaning       | Decimal |
| -------- | ------------- | ------- |
| 3/10     | 3 tenths      | 0.3     |
| 45/100   | 45 hundredths | 0.45    |
| 7/1000   | 7 thousandths | 0.007   |

👉 The **denominator** tells how many equal parts the whole is divided into.
👉 The **numerator** tells how many parts you have.

---

#### Method 2: Divide the numerator by the denominator

When the denominator is not 10, 100, or 1000, divide top ÷ bottom.

Example 1:
1 ÷ 2 = 0.5 → 1/2 = 0.5

Example 2:
3 ÷ 4 = 0.75 → 3/4 = 0.75

Example 3:
1 ÷ 8 = 0.125 → 1/8 = 0.125

**Tip:**
Use patterns and recall common conversions — you’ll see them often in exams.

| Fraction | Decimal |
| -------- | ------- |
| 1/2      | 0.5     |
| 1/4      | 0.25    |
| 3/4      | 0.75    |
| 1/5      | 0.2     |
| 3/5      | 0.6     |
| 1/8      | 0.125   |
| 3/8      | 0.375   |
| 5/8      | 0.625   |
| 7/8      | 0.875   |

### 🧮 How to convert **decimals → fractions**

1. **Say the decimal aloud** using place value.
2. Write it over its place value denominator.
3. **Simplify** if possible.

Example 1:
0.6 = 6 tenths = 6/10 = 3/5

Example 2:
0.25 = 25 hundredths = 25/100 = 1/4

Example 3:
0.125 = 125 thousandths = 125/1000 = 1/8

**Common mistakes:**

* Forgetting to simplify (0.5 = 5/10 → 1/2).
* Counting zeros wrongly (0.05 is 5 hundredths, not 5 tenths).
* Mixing up denominator size (bigger denominator → smaller parts).

### 🪙 Everyday analogy:

* Money: £0.50 = ½ of £1
* Measurements: 0.25 m = ¼ of a metre
* Time: 0.75 hour = ¾ of an hour = 45 minutes

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Convert 0.7 to a fraction
   → 7 tenths = 7/10

2. Convert 3/10 to a decimal
   → 3 ÷ 10 = 0.3

3. Convert 0.04 to a fraction
   → 4 hundredths = 4/100 = 1/25

4. Convert 5/8 to a decimal
   → 5 ÷ 8 = 0.625

5. Convert 0.125 to a fraction
   → 125/1000 = 1/8

6. Convert 2/5 to a decimal
   → 2 ÷ 5 = 0.4

7. Convert 0.75 to a fraction
   → 75 hundredths = 75/100 = 3/4
