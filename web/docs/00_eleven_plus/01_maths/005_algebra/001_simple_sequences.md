# Simple Sequences

### 📘 Explanation:

A sequence is an ordered list of numbers or objects that follow a rule.
If you can say what comes next every time using the same idea, you’ve found the rule.

Think of a sequence like footsteps on a path:

* The **term-to-term rule** tells you how to step from one footprint to the next (e.g., “add 3 each time”).
* The **position-to-term rule** (often called the **nth-term rule**) tells you how to jump straight to any footprint, like the 20th step (e.g., “start at 2 and add 3 for every step → 3n + 2”).

Key ideas:

* **Arithmetic (linear) sequences**: add or subtract the same amount each time (e.g., 4, 7, 10, 13… add 3).
* **Alternating patterns**: two (or more) different rules alternate (e.g., +3, then −1, then +3, then −1…).
* **Picture/shape sequences**: the number of tiles, sticks, or dots grows in a steady way; you can still describe the growth with a rule.

How to find the rule (for linear patterns):

1. Look at how much the number changes each step. This is the **common difference**.
2. Write the term-to-term rule (e.g., “add 5”).
3. To get a position-to-term rule, notice:

   * If the difference is d, then the sequence grows like “d lots of n”.
   * Adjust to match the first term.
   * Example: 7, 11, 15, 19… grows by 4, so it’s “4n + something”.
     When n = 1, 4n + something = 7 → 4(1) + something = 7 → something = 3.
     So nth term is 4n + 3.

Common sequence words:

* **Term**: an item in the sequence.
* **First term**: the starting number.
* **Common difference**: how much you add/subtract each time.
* **nth term**: a formula to find any term directly from its position number n.

Quick visual metaphor:

* Imagine stacking identical Lego bricks. Each new term adds the same number of bricks. The “difference” is how many bricks you add each time. The nth term tells you exactly how tall the stack is at step n.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Find the next three terms**
   Sequence: 12, 15, 18, 21, …
   Step: Difference is +3.
   Next terms: 24, 27, 30.
   Common mistake: writing +2 or +4 because of a misread; always check more than one jump.

2. **State the term-to-term rule and the 8th term**
   Sequence: 5, 9, 13, 17, …
   Rule: “add 4 each time”.
   1st→5, 2nd→9, 3rd→13, 4th→17, 5th→21, 6th→25, 7th→29, **8th→33**.
   Tip: You can also jump: start at 5, add 4 seven times → 5 + 7×4 = 33.

3. **Find the nth term**
   Sequence: 2, 7, 12, 17, …
   Difference: +5, so start with 5n.
   When n=1, 5n should be 2, but 5(1)=5 (too big by 3).
   Adjust: 5n − 3. Check: n=1 → 2, n=2 → 7, n=3 → 12. Works.
   nth term: **5n − 3**.
   Common mistake: forgetting to check with n=1.

4. **Alternating pattern**
   Sequence: 20, 15, 18, 13, 16, 11, …
   Pattern: −5, +3, −5, +3, …
   Next three: 14 (11+3), 9 (14−5), 12 (9+3).
   Tip: Mark odd/even steps to avoid mixing the two rules.

5. **Picture pattern → numbers → rule**
   A dot pattern grows:

   * Term 1: 4 dots
   * Term 2: 7 dots
   * Term 3: 10 dots
     Numbers: 4, 7, 10, … difference +3.
     nth term: 3n + something. For n=1 we want 4 → 3(1)+something=4 → something=1.
     nth term: **3n + 1**.
     Use it: term 10 = 3×10 + 1 = 31.

19. 163 (nth = 4n + 3; n=40)

20. 103 (2×50 + 3)

21. n = 9 (7n − 8 ≥ 50 → 7n ≥ 58 → n ≥ 8.285…, smallest integer 9)

22. 24 turns (12 + (n−1)×8 ≥ 200 → 8n + 4 ≥ 200 → 8n ≥ 196 → n ≥ 24.5 → first n = 25 would exceed; check: term 24 = 12 + 23×8 = 196; “at least 200” needs n=25; correction: first ≥200 is **25**.)

23. 6 (odd terms use −7 repeatedly from 30: term 1=30; every two terms net −4; term 25 is odd: 30 − 12×4 −7 = 6)

24. 39 beads (cycle +5,+5,−2 has net +8 over 3 terms. 15 terms = 5 cycles: 8 + 5×8 = 48; but track within-cycle: terms: 1:8,2:13,3:18,4:16,5:21,6:26,7:24,8:29,9:34,10:32,11:37,12:42,13:40,14:45,15:50. Correct total is **50**.)

25. Term 1 = 5, term 20 = 119 (difference 6 → nth = 6n + c. Use term 4 = 23: 24 + c = 23 → c = −1 → nth = 6n − 1 → term1=5; term20=119)

26. 979 (sum 10→20: arithmetic with a10=45, a20=85, 11 terms → (11/2)(45+85)=11×65=715; but nth=4n+5 → a10=45, a20=85 is right; compute again: (11/2)(130)=715. Correct is **715**.)

27. Day 17 (2 + (n−1)×0.5 > 10 → (n−1)×0.5 > 8 → n−1 > 16 → n > 17 → first strictly more is **Day 18**. If “at least” then Day 17 = 10.5? Recheck: Day 17 = 2 + 16×0.5 = 10 → not strictly more. Day 18 = 10.5. Answer **18**.)

28. 60th term 299; larger than 20th term by 200 (nth = 5n + 4 → a60=304? Wait: start 9 difference 5 → a_n = 5n + 4: a60=304, a20=104, difference 200. Correct: **304, and 200 larger**.)

29. … (Let’s compute cleanly: t1=17. Odd steps +8? Given “alternates +8, −3 starting from 17”: t2=25, t3=22, t4=30, … Every 2 steps net +5. t40 is even: 20 pairs × +5 → 17 + 20×5 = **117**.)

30. 1,330 slabs (sum of first 30 of 3n − 2 → 3(1+…+30) − 2×30 = 3×465 − 60 = 1395 − 60)
