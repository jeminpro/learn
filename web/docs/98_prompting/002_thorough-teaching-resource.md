# Thorough teaching resource

```md
I am preparing for the **11 Plus (GL/CEM) exams** and would like a **thorough teaching resource** on **Decimals**, broken down by individual concept.

For each of the listed topics below, I want you to perform the following: 

---

### 📚 TOPICS TO COVER:

1. Decimal place value
2. Adding and subtracting decimals
3. Multiplying and dividing decimals
4. Converting decimals and fractions
5. Order and compare decimals

---

### 🔹 FOR EACH TOPIC, DO THE FOLLOWING:

1. **Explain the Concept Clearly**

   * Assume the learner is **9 to 11 years old** with solid basics
   * Use **visual metaphors, everyday analogies**, and define terms in simple language
   * Break complex ideas into clear steps

2. **Provide 3 to 5 Examples**

   * Mix of worked numerical examples and diagram-based/real-life style
   * Clearly show **step-by-step methods**
   * Include **common mistakes** and how to avoid them

3. **Create 30 Word Problems (Aligned to 11 Plus Style)**
   Group them by difficulty:

   * 🔹 10 Easy
   * 🔸 10 Medium
   * 🔺 10 Hard

   Make problems:

   * Clear but non-trivial (especially in Medium and Hard)
   * Aligned with real-life contexts (shopping, sharing, measurements, games, etc.)
   * Include **mix of types**: single-step, multi-step, puzzles, comparisons, missing value, reasoning
   * Designed for mental maths, short written workings, or deeper logical thinking
   * Suitable for timed exam practice

4. **Provide the Answer Key**

   * Show just the final answers under a separate heading: **Answers**
   * If possible, include one-line justifications (especially for Medium and Hard)

---

### 🧠 Notes to the AI:

* Stay consistent in notation and use KaTeX math blocks where applicable in the markdown
* Keep the markdown neater and compatabale for docusaurus docs
* Word problems must be **age-appropriate but challenging**, reflecting 11 Plus expectations
* Encourage **reasoning and logic**, not just rote calculation
* Do not repeat templates or values excessively — prioritize variety and creativity
* Use familiar UK-style measurements (pounds, litres, cm, etc.)
* Avoid calculator-required values (stick to manageable mental math numbers)
* Please do one topic at a time
