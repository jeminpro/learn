## 🎯 11 Plus (GL/CEM) Test Paper Generator

I am preparing for the **11 Plus (GL/CEM) exams** and would like you to create a **test paper** for each of the topics listed below.

---

### 📚 Topics to Cover

1. Simple Sequences
2. Substitution
3. Solving Equations

---

### 🔹 FOR EACH TOPIC, DO THE FOLLOWING

#### 1. Create Word Problems

* Write **6 questions per topic**
* Group by difficulty:

  * 🔸 **2 Medium**
  * 🔺 **4 Hard**
* Each problem should:

  * Be clear but **non-trivial**, suitable for 9–11-year-olds.
  * Reflect **real-life contexts** (shopping, sharing, measurements, games, etc.).
  * Include a **mix of types**: single-step, multi-step, reasoning, comparison, missing value, and logic-based puzzles.
  * Be solvable through **mental maths or short written workings** — no calculator required.
  * Fit **11 Plus timing and style**, encouraging reasoning over rote calculation.
* Leave **three blank lines** after each question for student working space.

#### 2. Provide the Answer Key

* Place answers under a separate heading: **Answers**
* Include **final answers only**, with **one-line justifications** where appropriate.

---

### 🧠 Notes for the AI

* Use **clean Markdown formatting** suitable for Docusaurus docs (no LaTeX blocks).
* Keep notation **consistent** (e.g., “×” for multiply, “÷” for divide, £ for pounds, cm/L/kg for units).
* Ensure **variety** — avoid repetitive templates or numbers.
* Use **UK conventions** for language and measurements.
* Maintain **exam realism** and **creativity** — the problems should feel authentic to real 11 Plus practice materials.
