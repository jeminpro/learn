# 11+ Answering Strategy

## **A. How to Mark Answers Safely in the Question Booklet**

Use **3 symbols**, each with a clear meaning:

### **1️⃣ Tick (✓) — CONFIDENT ANSWER**

* You are 100% sure.
* This answer will be transferred to the answer sheet when the page is finished.

### **2️⃣ Circle the Answer Option — UNSURE (Chosen but needs double-checking)**

* You circle the option
* This means:
  “I have picked this answer, but if I have time later, I want to recheck it.”
* Circle stands out clearly.
* Prevents confusion with skipped questions.

### **3️⃣ Circle the QUESTION NUMBER — SKIPPED (No answer yet)**

* You circle the number itself.
* Means you are skipping this question completely for now.
* Ensures you do NOT accidentally fill an answer for it.

**Simple rule:**

* **Tick = final**
* **Circle answer = chosen but unsure**
* **Circle Q number = skipped**

# ⭐ **B. When to Fill the Answer Sheet**

### **Transfer answers PAGE-BY-PAGE.**

Not question-by-question.
Not at the very end.

This is the safest method because:

* Prevents misalignment
* Keeps each page of answers clean
* Removes the “skipped Q4 → accidentally filled Q5 in Q4 slot” disaster


### When transferring:

* Write only the ✓ answers
* Leave blanks for circled options (unsure)
* Leave blanks for circled question numbers (skipped)

---

# ⭐ **C. The Revisit Order (End-of-Test Strategy)**

After all sections are answered in the booklet:

### **1️⃣ First return to circled question numbers (skipped)**

These need more thinking time.
When answered:

* Tick the chosen/closest option
* Transfer to the answer sheet
* Remove the circle

### **2️⃣ Return to circled answer options (chosen but unsure)**

Keep this at the end as you have already chosen.
Once you finalise the answer:

* Put a tick next to the circle if you are sure that is the correct choice
* If you are confused still, move on

# ⭐ **D. Final 1-Minute Alignment Check**

Before time ends:
1. Move down line-by-line
2. Ensure:
   * Every question has exactly one answer
   * All skipped questions are now answered
3. Put finger on **Q1** in answer sheet
4. Match it with **Q1** in booklet


Takes 45–60 seconds and prevents major errors.

# ⭐ **E. Visual Summary (Memory Aid)**

### **In the Question Booklet**

* ✓ = confident
* ○ on option = chosen but unsure (to recheck later)
* ○ around question number = skipped

### **On the Answer Sheet**

* Transfer ✓ answers section-by-section
* Recheck ○ answers → tick → transfer
* Answer skipped questions → tick → transfer
* Do final alignment scan
