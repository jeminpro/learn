          ## Oct 2025 Progress

          **Areas for focus:**

          * Difficulty remembering literary devices
          * Need to distinguish between **Metaphor** vs **Simile**
          * Practice with:
            1. Personification
            2. Rule of Three
            3. Imagery

          > Needs more reinforcement drills with varied examples.

          ```
          Example Metaphor: The classroom was a zoo.
          Example Simile: The classroom was like a zoo.
          ```
