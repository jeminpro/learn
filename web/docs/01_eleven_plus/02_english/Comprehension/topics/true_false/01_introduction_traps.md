# 📝 Introduction

True / False / Not Given (TFNG) is a common type of comprehension question.  
It tests whether you can **match a statement** to the information in a passage.  

---

## ✅ The Rules

- **True (T):** The statement **agrees** with the passage.  
- **False (F):** The statement **contradicts** the passage (opposite meaning).  
- **Not Given (NG):** The passage does **not say enough** to decide.

## 🔍 How to Answer Step by Step

1. **Read the statement carefully.**  
   Break it into keywords and main ideas.  

2. **Find the information in the passage.**  
   Look for matching ideas or paraphrased words (synonyms, rephrasing).  

3. **Compare the meaning.**  
   - If the passage and statement mean the **same thing** → **True**  
   - If the passage says the **opposite** → **False**  
   - If the passage says **nothing (or not enough)** → **Not Given**

## 🎯 Key Tips

- Don’t use **outside knowledge** — only the passage.  
- Watch for **trap words** like *always, never, all, only*.  
- Be careful with **numbers, times, and dates**.  
- If you find yourself **guessing or assuming**, the answer is usually **Not Given**.

“Marie Curie discovered radium. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize.”  

**Statements:**  
1. Marie Curie discovered radium. → ✅ **True**  
2. Marie Curie discovered uranium. → ❌ **False** (different element)  
3. Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes. → ❓ **Not Given** (only mentions “a Nobel Prize,” not how many)

# ✨ Quick Recap

- **True = Same meaning**  
- **False = Opposite meaning**  
- **Not Given = Missing / not enough info**  

# 🚨 TFNG Traps List

## 1. Exaggeration Words
Look out for: *always, never, all, none, only, every, completely*  
- **Text:** “Some students enjoyed the trip.”  
- **Statement:** “All students enjoyed the trip.” → **False** (too strong).  

---

## 2. Time Traps
Examiners love using **time of day** or **dates**.  
- **Text:** “The museum closes at 5 p.m.”  
- **Statement:** “The museum stays open until evening.” → **False**  
- **Statement:** “The museum opens at 10 a.m.” → **Not Given**  

---

## 3. Number / Quantity Tricks
Watch exact vs approximate numbers.  
- **Text:** “The library has more than 50,000 books.”  
- **Statement:** “The library has fewer than 50,000 books.” → **False**  
- **Statement:** “The library has exactly 50,000 books.” → **False**  
- **Statement:** “The library has thousands of books.” → **True**  

---

## 4. Cause and Effect Confusion
Examiners twist whether something **caused** or just **happened**.  
- **Text:** “The heavy rain delayed the match.”  
- **Statement:** “The match caused the heavy rain.” → **False**  
- **Statement:** “The match was delayed by the weather.” → **True**  
- **Statement:** “The rain cancelled the match completely.” → **Not Given**  

---

## 5. Opinion vs Fact
If the passage shows someone’s opinion, but the statement makes it sound like fact.  
- **Text:** “Many scientists believe climate change is speeding up.”  
- **Statement:** “Climate change is definitely speeding up.” → **False**  
- **Statement:** “Some scientists believe climate change is speeding up.” → **True**  

---

## 6. Comparisons
Examiners test whether something is bigger/smaller, more/less.  
- **Text:** “Cats are more popular pets than rabbits.”  
- **Statement:** “Rabbits are more popular than cats.” → **False**  
- **Statement:** “Dogs are more popular than cats.” → **Not Given**  

---

## 7. Missing Detail (Extra Information)
When the statement adds info not in the passage.  
- **Text:** “The library has free internet access.”  
- **Statement:** “The library has free internet on computers.” → **Not Given**  

---

## 8. Paraphrase Tricks
Same idea, different words. Don’t just look for exact matches.  
- **Text:** “Edison developed the first practical bulb for homes.”  
- **Statement:** “Edison made a light bulb people could use at home.” → **True**  

---

## 9. Scope Trap
Watch out for part vs whole.  
- **Text:** “The company expanded into European cities.”  
- **Statement:** “The company expanded across Europe.” → **False**  

---

## 10. Outside Knowledge
Even if you know the fact in real life, ignore it unless it’s in the text.  
- **Text:** “Marie Curie won a Nobel Prize.”  
- **Statement:** “Marie Curie won two Nobel Prizes.” → **Not Given**  

---

# ✅ Quick Rule of Thumb
- If the passage **agrees in meaning** → **True**.  
- If it **contradicts** → **False**.  
- If it’s **not stated or not enough info** → **Not Given**.
