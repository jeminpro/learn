11+ Comprehension — Ultimate Time-Saving Strategy 
________________________________________
1. Read the Question Stems First (20–30 seconds)
•	Do not read the answer choices yet.
•	This tells your brain what to look for (feelings, facts, vocabulary, inference, tone).
•	Underline trap words in the question:
not • never • least • most • only • except
This prevents opposite-answer mistakes.
Example:
Which word is not similar to “angry”? → Underline not.

2. Read the Passage Once — Slow and Active
While reading, lightly mark:
•	Circle names
•	Underline feelings/emotions
•	Mark contrasts (however, although, but)
•	Box unusual or striking phrases
Do not over-underline. Only mark key ideas.

3. Use “Question Order Clue” to Save Time
In GL/CEM papers:
Answers appear in passage order.
•	If you can’t find Q6, check just after the place where you found Q5.
•	Do not search the entire passage.

4. Mark the Passage With Question Numbers
Every time you find an answer:
•	Write a tiny question number (e.g., Q4) in the margin next to that line.
Benefits: This is a top-scorer technique.
•	Helps with inference and cross-reference questions
•	Creates a visual answer map
•	Avoids re-reading the whole passage

5. Answer Using the SCAN + TARGET Method
Literal / Retrieval
Find the exact sentence → choose the matching answer.
Inference
Return only to the relevant paragraph.
Use clues: emotions, actions, reactions, contrasts.
Vocabulary
Read the sentence before and after the word.
Writer’s Purpose / Tone
Use your underlined emotional words and contrasts.
Main Idea
Do this last.
Use your mental summary of the whole passage.

6. Eliminate Wrong Answers First
Most MCQs have:
•	1 correct answer
•	1 close answer
•	2 wrong answers
Steps:
1.	Cross out the clearly wrong answers.
2.	Between the last two, check which option fits the whole sentence or tone.
3.	If unsure, choose the option that best matches the passage’s mood.
Wrong answers often:
•	sound too extreme
•	contradict the tone
•	add new information
•	do not fit the context

7. Skip Fast, Return Later
•	If stuck for more than 30 seconds, skip.
•	Often, later questions give clues for earlier ones.
•	Return at the end.
Do not lose time on a single question.

8. Final Check (30 seconds)
•	Re-check NOT / EXCEPT / LEAST questions
•	Make sure answers match the text, not assumptions
•	Quickly scan for accidental patterns (e.g., picking the same option repeatedly)
________________________________________
9. Vocabulary / Meaning Questions
When asked what a word means:
1.	Read the full sentence again.
2.	Decide if the word feels positive/negative.
3.	Replace it with a simple word that fits the meaning.
4.	Choose the option that best fits the context.
Ignore dictionary definitions. Use the meaning in this passage.
Example:
“He trudged home through the rain.”
Trudged = walked slowly and tiredly.

10. Inference Questions (Reading Between the Lines)
The answer is not written directly.
Use clues:
•	verbs
•	emotions
•	body language
•	reactions
Avoid wild guesses. Stick to what the text shows.
Example:
“Ben stared at his shoes.”
→ He is probably embarrassed or guilty.

11. Tone and Feeling Questions
Use clues such as:
•	emotion words
•	punctuation ( ! … ? )
•	body language verbs
Examples:
•	“She clenched her fists.” → Angry / tense
•	“He shuffled away.” → Sad / ashamed
•	“He grinned widely.” → Happy / relieved

12. True / False / Not Given
•	True → clearly stated
•	False → clearly opposite
•	Not Given → not mentioned at all
Do not overthink. If it’s not in the text → Not Given.
