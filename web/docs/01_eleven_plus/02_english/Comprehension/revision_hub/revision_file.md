# 🟡 4. Inference

### Instructions

* Be a **detective**: look for clues in actions, words, or descriptions.
* Always answer with **evidence from the text**.
* Use this frame if you are stuck:
  *“I think [idea] because the text says ‘[quote]’.”*
* How to Infer
Look at actions: “He shuffled his feet and looked away.” → He feels nervous.
Look at dialogue: “I suppose… if I must,” she said reluctantly. → She doesn’t want to.
Look at descriptions: “Dark clouds gathered and the wind howled.” → Suggests something bad is coming.

# 🟠 **5. Main Idea**

* Other sentences give **details, examples, or explanations**.

* Strategies
One-sentence rule: Can you explain the whole paragraph in one sentence?
Headline test: Imagine this paragraph was a news story. What headline would fit?
Elimination: In MCQs, remove options that are too narrow (detail only) or too broad (covering the whole text, not just one paragraph).

# 🟤 **7. True / False / Not Given (TFNG)**

## 📝 **Introduction**

---

   Break it into keywords and main ideas.

2. **Find the information in the passage.**
   Look for matching ideas or paraphrased words (synonyms, rephrasing).

   * If the passage and statement mean the **same thing** → **True**
   * If the passage says the **opposite** → **False**
   * If the passage says **nothing (or not enough)** → **Not Given**

---

## 🎯 **Key Tips**

* Don’t use **outside knowledge** — only the passage.
* Watch for **trap words** like *always, never, all, only*.
* Be careful with **numbers, times, and dates**.
* If you find yourself **guessing or assuming**, the answer is usually **Not Given**.
