# ⭐ 11+ Comprehension — Ultimate Time-Saving Strategy 

## **1️⃣ Read the Question Stems FIRST (20–30 seconds)**

* Do **not** read the answer choices yet.
* This tells your brain what to look for (feelings, facts, vocabulary, inference, tone).
* Underline any **trap words** in the question:

  * **not, never, least, most, only, except**

This prevents opposite-answer mistakes.
**Example:**  
> Which word is **not similar** to “angry”?  
Underline “not”! Most mistakes happen because it’s missed.

## **2️⃣ Read the Passage ONCE — Slow and Active**

While reading, lightly mark:

* Circle **names**
* Underline **feelings/emotions**
* Mark **contrasts** (however, although, but)
* Box **unusual phrases**

Don’t over-underline — just key ideas.

---

## **3️⃣ Use “Question Order Clue” to Save Time**

In GL/CEM:

📌 **Answers appear in passage order**.

So:

* If you cannot find Q6,
  check just after the place where you found Q5.
* Don’t search the whole passage — it wastes time.

This alone saves up to **1–2 minutes**.

---

## **4️⃣ Mark the Passage With Question Numbers**

Every time he finds an answer:

👉 Write a tiny **Q number** (e.g., “Q4”) in the margin next to that line.

Benefits:

* Lets him go back easily for inference questions
* Prevents losing place
* Gives instant visual map of where each answer is
* Stops re-reading the whole passage

This is a top-scorer technique.

## **5️⃣ Answer Using SCAN + TARGET**

For each question:

### **Literal / retrieval**

Find the exact sentence → choose the answer.

### **Inference**

Return only to the *relevant paragraph*.
Use emotions, actions, reactions, and contrasts.

### **Vocabulary**

Read the **sentence before and after** the word.

### **Writer’s purpose / tone**

Use your underlined emotional words & contrasts.

### **Main idea**

Do **last**. Use your mental summary.

## 6️⃣ Eliminate Wrong Answers First 

Most questions have **one correct**, **one almost right**, and **two wrong** options.

✅ Cross out obvious wrongs quickly.  
✅ Between two close ones, check **which fits the whole sentence or tone**.  
✅ If unsure, pick the answer that matches the **mood** of the passage.

**Tip:** Wrong answers often sound too extreme, or don’t match the text’s feeling.

---

## **7️⃣ Skip Fast, Return Later**

Never get stuck.

If an answer takes more than **30 seconds**, skip and come back.

Often, the next question gives a clue.

---

## **8️⃣ Final Check (30 seconds)**

* Re-check questions with **NOT / EXCEPT / LEAST**
* Make sure answers match the text, not assumptions
* Quick look at answer order — there shouldn’t be two identical letter patterns accidentally chosen due to rushing

---

## 9️⃣ Vocabulary / Meaning Questions

When asked what a word means:
1. Read the full sentence again.  
2. Think: does the word sound **positive or negative**?  
3. Replace it mentally with a simple synonym.  
4. Choose the option that fits best.

✅ Ignore dictionary meanings — choose what fits **in context**.

**Example:**  
> “He trudged home through the rain.”  
“Trudged” = walked **slowly and tiredly**, not just “walked”.

---

## 🔟 Inference Questions (Reading Between the Lines)

You won’t find the answer directly.  
Ask yourself: *What does this show? What does this tell me about the character?*

✅ Check verbs, emotions, or body language.  
✅ Avoid dramatic guesses — stick to clues in the text.

**Example:**  
> “Ben stared at his shoes.” → He’s probably **embarrassed or guilty**, not just looking down.

---

## 1️⃣1️⃣ Tone and Feeling Questions

When asked how a character feels or what the tone is:
- Check emotion words, punctuation (!, …, ?)
- Look for verbs that reveal attitude (snapped, sighed, whispered)
- Read the whole sentence, not just one word

| Clue | Feeling |
|------|----------|
| “She clenched her fists.” | Angry or tense |
| “He shuffled away.” | Sad or ashamed |
| “He grinned widely.” | Happy or relieved |

---

## 1️⃣2️⃣ True / False / Not Given 

✅ **True** → clearly stated in the text  
✅ **False** → clearly opposite of what’s in the text  
✅ **Not Given** → not mentioned at all  

Don’t overthink — if it’s not there, mark “Not Given”.
