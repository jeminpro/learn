# Subject Verb Agreement

# ⭐ **What is Subject–Verb Agreement?**

Subject–Verb Agreement means:

👉 **The verb must match the subject in number.**

* **Singular subject → Singular verb (usually ends with –s)**
* **Plural subject → Plural verb (no –s)**

**Examples:**

* The dog **barks**. (singular)
* The dogs **bark**. (plural)

> **He / she / it = verb gets S**
> **I / you / we / they = verb has NO S**
