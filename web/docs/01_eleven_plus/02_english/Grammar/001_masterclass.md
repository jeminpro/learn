### 🧠 GL Exam Tip
Grammar is often **blended with vocabulary** in GL questions — e.g., a question might test both **meaning** and **grammar accuracy**. Always read the entire sentence for context.

To perform well in these, your child needs a **solid command of grammar, vocabulary, and sentence structure**.

Train the child to use *elimination* and *grammar checks*.

| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Read full sentence aloud                  | Helps hear what sounds natural             |
| Identify the word type needed             | Noun? Verb? Adjective?                     |
