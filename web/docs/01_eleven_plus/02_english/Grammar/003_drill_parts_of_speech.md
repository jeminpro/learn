## 🧠 **Teaching Tip**

To check your answer:

* If it **names** something → **noun**
* If it **shows action** → **verb**
* If it **describes a noun** → **adjective**
* If it **describes a verb/adjective/adverb** → **adverb**
* If it **joins** or **connects** → **conjunction**
* If it **shows position/time** → **preposition**
* If it **replaces a noun** → **pronoun**
* If it **points to or introduces a noun** → **article/determiner**
* If it **shows sudden emotion** → **interjection**

1. **Underline** the bold word and ask:
   👉 “What job is it doing?” (naming? describing? doing? connecting?)
2. **Swap words:**

   * If it can take “the/a” before it → likely **noun**
   * If you can add “to” before it → likely **verb**
   * If it describes something → **adjective**
   * If it tells *how/when/where* → **adverb**
3. **Read aloud:** if it *describes* → adjective/adverb; if it *acts* → verb.
