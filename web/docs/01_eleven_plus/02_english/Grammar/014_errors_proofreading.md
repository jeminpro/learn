# Errors and Proofreading

---

## 🧠 Explanation

**Proofreading** means reading carefully to **find and correct mistakes** in grammar, spelling, punctuation, or word choice.  

In the GL 11+ exam, these questions check if you can **spot the sentence that is written correctly** or **find the error** among several similar sentences.

## 🔑 Key Grammar Checks

Here’s what you must look for when proofreading:

| Error Type | What to Check | Example |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| **Subject–Verb Agreement** | The verb matches the subject. | ❌ *The dogs runs fast.* → ✅ *The dogs run fast.* |
| **Tense Consistency** | The verb tense stays the same. | ❌ *I eat breakfast and went to school.* → ✅ *I ate breakfast and went to school.* |
| **Pronoun Agreement** | Pronouns match the nouns they replace. | ❌ *Every boy brought their lunch.* → ✅ *Every boy brought his lunch.* |
| **Adjective vs Adverb** | Use the correct describing form. | ❌ *She runs quick.* → ✅ *She runs quickly.* |
| **Double Negatives** | Only one negative should appear. | ❌ *I didn’t see nothing.* → ✅ *I didn’t see anything.* |
| **Homophones** | Words that sound alike but have different meanings. | ❌ *There going home.* → ✅ *They’re going home.* |
| **Fragment / Run-on Sentences** | Every sentence needs a full idea and proper punctuation. | ❌ *Because I was late.* → ✅ *I was late because the bus broke down.* |

## ✏️ Examples

| Incorrect | Correct | Rule |
|------------|----------|------|
| *The girl were singing loudly.* | *The girl was singing loudly.* | Subject–verb agreement |
| *He has went to the shop.* | *He has gone to the shop.* | Correct verb form |
| *I can’t hardly wait.* | *I can hardly wait.* | Avoid double negatives |
| *Its a sunny day.* | *It’s a sunny day.* | Contraction vs possession |
| *The book was more better.* | *The book was better.* | Avoid double comparatives |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- Watch out for **sentences that sound right but are wrong** — GL uses these to test your ear for grammar.  
- Check **verb forms after “has/have/had”** → must be past participles (gone, eaten, written).  
- **Homophones** like *their / there / they’re*, *your / you’re*, *its / it’s* appear often.  
- Some questions test **word choice** (“less” vs “fewer”, “much” vs “many”).  
- Always read the **whole sentence** — sometimes the mistake is at the end.

3. Reward accuracy and reasoning (“Why is that wrong?”).  

This game builds sharp proofreading instincts — exactly what GL looks for.
