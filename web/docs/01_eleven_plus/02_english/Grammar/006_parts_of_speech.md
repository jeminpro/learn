# Parts of Speech

---

## 🧠 Explanation

Every word in English belongs to a **word family** called a **part of speech**.  
Knowing the parts of speech helps you understand how sentences work and how to fix grammar mistakes in the GL exam.

There are **8 main parts of speech**.

| Part of Speech | What It Does | Example Sentence |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Noun** | A person, place, thing, or idea | *The **dog** barked loudly.* |
| **Verb** | Shows an action or state of being | *She **runs** every morning.* |
| **Adjective** | Describes a noun | *The **tall** man smiled.* |
| **Adverb** | Describes a verb, adjective, or another adverb (often ends in *-ly*) | *She ran **quickly**.* |
| **Pronoun** | Replaces a noun | *Sarah is kind. **She** helps others.* |
| **Preposition** | Shows relationship (place, time, direction) | *The cat sat **on** the mat.* |
| **Conjunction** | Joins words, phrases, or clauses | *I wanted to play, **but** it rained.* |
| **Determiner** | Comes before a noun to show which one or how many | *I saw **the** dog.* |
| **Interjection** | Shows emotion or reaction | *Wow! That’s amazing!* |

## ⚠️ Tricky Bits

- **Adjectives vs Adverbs:**  
  - Adjectives describe *nouns* → *The quick fox.*  
  - Adverbs describe *verbs* → *The fox ran quickly.*  
  ❌ *He ran quick.* → ✅ *He ran quickly.*

- **Prepositions** can look small but matter a lot!  
  - *in, on, under, by, between, after, during, before, with*

- **Conjunctions** change sentence structure:  
  - *I wanted to go, but it was raining.*  
  - *Although it was raining, I wanted to go.*
