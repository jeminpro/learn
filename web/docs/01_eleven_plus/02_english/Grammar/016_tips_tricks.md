# Tips & Tricks 

*How to master grammar for the 11+ English & Verbal Skills paper — Gloucestershire GL version.*

---

## 🎯 Overview
The GL grammar section tests how well you can **spot what sounds wrong** or **choose what fits best**.  
These tips focus on speed, accuracy, and pattern recognition — the keys to success in multiple-choice grammar.

---

## 🧩 1. Hear the Grammar in Your Head
> Grammar is a *listening game.*

When choosing between options:
> *The boy run / runs fast.*

✅ Read both aloud quietly — what *sounds right* is usually right.  
📚 **Readers perform better** because they’ve “heard” correct grammar many times.

---

## ⚙️ 2. The “S” Trap — Subject–Verb Agreement

| Subject | Verb | Example |
|----------|------|----------|
| He | runs | He runs quickly. |
| They | run | They run quickly. |

🪄 **Trick:**  
- Singular = verb **ends with “s”**  
- Plural = verb **does not**

> *The dogs (run / runs) fast → ✅ run*

---

## ⏳ 3. Time Travel Test (for Tenses)
Find the time word — it tells you which tense to use.

> “Yesterday I eat lunch and went home.” ❌  
> “Yesterday I ate lunch and went home.” ✅

🪄 **Trick:** “yesterday” = past, “now” = present, “tomorrow” = future.

---

## 🧱 4. “Because” Never Stands Alone
> ❌ *Because it was raining.*  
> ✅ *I stayed inside because it was raining.*

🪄 **Trick:** If it starts with *because, although, when, since,* it needs another part after it.

---

## 👥 5. Who / Which / That

| Word | Refers to | Example |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **who** | people | *The boy who smiled won.* |
| **which** | things | *The car which was red sped past.* |
| **that** | people or things (less formal) | *The book that I read was great.* |

🪄 **Trick:** If you can replace it with *he* → use **who**.

---

## ✨ 6. “Was” or “Were”? (The Wish Trick)
Use **were** when imagining or wishing.

✅ *If I were you, I’d study harder.*  
❌ *If I was you…*

🪄 **Trick:** *Imaginary = were.*

---

## 🔍 7. Adjective vs Adverb — The “How?” Test
Ask: *How is the action done?*

| Sentence | Rule | Correct Form |
|-----------|------|---------------|
| He runs quick. ❌ | Use adverb | He runs **quickly.** ✅ |
| He is quick. ✅ | Describes noun | — |

🪄 **Trick:**  
- Answers *how?* → **adverb**  
- Answers *what kind?* → **adjective**

---

## 🔊 8. Active or Passive? (The “By” Test)

| Type | Example |
|------|----------|
| Active | The chef cooked the meal. |
| Passive | The meal was cooked **by** the chef. |

🪄 **Trick:** If it ends with “by [someone]”, it’s **passive**.

---

## 🧩 9. Prefix & Suffix Sense Check
When a word looks odd, check its parts.

| Part | Meaning | Example |
|------|----------|----------|
| **un-** | not | *unhappy* |
| **dis-** | opposite | *disagree* |
| **-ful** | full of | *hopeful* |
| **-less** | without | *hopeless* |
| **-ness** | state of being | *kindness* |

🪄 **Trick:** Cover the prefix/suffix — does the root still make sense?

---

## 💬 10. Direct → Reported Speech Shortcut

Drop quotes, move tense back one step, change pronouns/time words.

| Direct | Reported |
|--------|-----------|
| “I am tired.” | He said he **was** tired. |
| “I will go tomorrow.” | He said he **would** go the next day. |

🪄 **Trick:** “One step back” — am → was, will → would, can → could.

---

## 🚫 11. Double Negative Danger
❌ *I didn’t see nothing.*  
✅ *I didn’t see anything.*

🪄 **Trick:** Two negatives make a positive — use only one.

---

## ✏️ 12. Watch Out for Comma Splices
❌ *It rained, we stayed home.*  
✅ *It rained, so we stayed home.*  
✅ *It rained; we stayed home.*

🪄 **Trick:** A comma joining sentences needs a helper (*so, but, and*).

---

## 👤 13. Pronoun Reference Rule
Pronouns must point clearly to one noun.

❌ *When Jack met Sam, he smiled.* (Who?)  
✅ *When Jack met Sam, Jack smiled.*

🪄 **Trick:** Replace pronoun with the noun — does it still make sense?

---

## ⚖️ 14. Collective Noun Agreement
Treat groups as **singular** when acting together.

✅ *The team won its match.*  
Plural only when individuals act separately:  
✅ *The team took their seats.*

🪄 **Trick:** together → *its*, separately → *their*.

---

## 🔍 15. The “Sound Right” Scan
GL questions love phrases like:
> *The boy done his homework.*

🪄 **Trick:** Say it aloud — if it sounds wrong, it probably is.  
Correct version: *The boy **did** his homework.*

---

## 💥 16. Exclamation Formula
| Type | Structure | Example |
|------|------------|----------|
| With noun | **What + a/an + adjective + noun!** | *What a wonderful day!* |
| With adjective/adverb | **How + adjective/adverb!** | *How beautiful it looks!* |

🪄 **Trick:** “What” for nouns, “How” for feelings.

---

## 🧠 17. Clause Completion Check
If it starts with *because, although, when, since,* it needs a **main clause** to complete it.

✅ *Because I was late, I missed the bus.*  
❌ *Because I was late.*

🪄 **Trick:** Does it feel unfinished? Add the main idea.

---

## 🧩 18. Elimination Strategy (Exam Hack)
1. Eliminate silly or ungrammatical options first.  
2. Compare remaining two carefully — look for tense or agreement errors.  
3. Read full sentence **aloud in your head** before choosing.

---

## 🔁 19. The “Swap Test” for Conjunctions
Swap the two parts to test if it’s coordinating or subordinating.

| Type | Example | Swap Test |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Coordinating | *We stayed in and watched TV.* | ✅ Still makes sense both ways. |
| Subordinating | *We stayed in because it rained.* | ❌ Can’t swap sides easily. |

🪄 **Trick:** Swap = coordinating; can’t swap = subordinating.

---

## 📚 20. Build a Grammar Ear — Not Just Memory
- Read aloud daily (a few paragraphs).  
- Notice patterns like **is + -ing**, **was + -ed**, **has + past participle**.  
- Correct spoken sentences as mini-games.

🎮 Example:  
Parent: *The children plays outside.*  
Child: *No — The children **play** outside!*

🪄 **Trick:** Natural correction builds grammar instincts faster than drills alone.

---

| Skill | Fast Tip |
