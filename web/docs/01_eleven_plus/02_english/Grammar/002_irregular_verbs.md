### 🎯 **Learning Goal**

To understand what **irregular verbs** are, how they **change differently in the past tense and past participle**, and how to use them correctly in 11+ grammar and writing questions.

> 🧠 Regular verbs add **–ed** in the past (walk → walked),
> but **irregular verbs** *do not follow this pattern* (go → went → gone).

---

## 🟦 1. What Is an Irregular Verb?

**Definition:**
An **irregular verb** changes its form **without adding –ed** when we talk about the past or past participle.

| Type      | Example           | Explanation             |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------------------- |
| Regular   | play → played     | adds “–ed”              |
| Irregular | eat → ate → eaten | completely changes form |

**In 11+ questions**, these are tested by:
✅ choosing the correct verb form
✅ spotting tense errors
✅ completing sentences that sound right

## 🟩 2. Verb Forms Recap

Every verb has **three main forms**:

| Form                  | Function                     | Example (to go) |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------- |
| **Base (Infinitive)** | Present tense / after “to”   | go              |
| **Past tense**        | Simple past                  | went            |
| **Past participle**   | Used with *have / has / had* | gone            |

**Example sentences:**

* I **go** to school every day. *(base)*
* I **went** to school yesterday. *(past)*
* I **have gone** to school already. *(past participle)*

## 🟨 3. Common Irregular Verb Patterns

Let’s look at patterns to help remember them 👇

---

### 🔹 **Group 1 – All Three Forms the Same**

| Base | Past | Past Participle | Example Sentence               |
| ---- | ---- | --------------- | ------------------------------ |

| put  | put  | put             | She **put** her bag down.      |
| hurt | hurt | hurt            | He **hurt** his leg.           |
| shut | shut | shut            | They **shut** the door.        |

## 🟪 5. Common 11+ Mistakes

| ❌ Wrong                    | ✅ Correct                   | Why                                        |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| He **has went** to school. | He **has gone** to school.  | “Gone” is the past participle, not “went”. |
| She **was ate** lunch.     | She **ate** lunch.          | “Ate” is simple past, not with *was*.      |
| I **have saw** that film.  | I **have seen** that film.  | Use *seen* after *have*.                   |
| They **was running** fast. | They **were running** fast. | “They” → “were.”                           |

🧠 **11+ Trick:**
If you use *have, has, had* → always use the **past participle**, not the simple past.
