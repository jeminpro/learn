# Verb Forms and Tenses

---

## 🧠 Explanation

A **verb** is a word that shows an **action** (*run, jump, eat*)  
or a **state of being** (*is, seem, become*).

Verbs change their form depending on **when** something happens — this is called **tense**.

---

# PART 1 — **What Are Verb Tenses?**

Verb tenses tell us **when** an action happens.

There are **three main time frames**:

1. **Present** – happening now / regularly
2. **Past** – already happened
3. **Future** – will happen

Each of these has **four forms**:

* **Simple**
* **Progressive (Continuous)**
* **Perfect**
* **Perfect Progressive**

This gives **12 tenses** in total.

The verb must **agree** with the subject in number (singular/plural).

### 🔹 Singular subject → singular verb (usually +s)
