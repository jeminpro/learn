# 💬 Speech Marks (Direct Speech)

---

## 🎯 Purpose
Speech marks (also called **quotation marks**) show the **exact words spoken** by someone.  
They make writing lively and help the reader follow dialogue clearly.

In British English, we use **double quotation marks “ ”** for direct speech.

## 🧩 1. The Basics of Direct Speech

Every direct speech sentence has **two parts**:
- **What is said** (inside the speech marks)
- **Who said it** (the reporting clause)

✅ *Examples:*  
> “I love reading,” said Maya.  
> Tom shouted, “Hurry up!”  
> “Be quiet!” yelled the teacher.

---

### 🔹 Key Rules

1️⃣ **Use quotation marks (“ ”)** around *exact words spoken*.  
2️⃣ **Capitalise the first word** inside the speech marks.  
3️⃣ **End punctuation (comma, ?, !)** goes **inside** the closing speech mark if it belongs to the spoken words.  
4️⃣ **Reporting clause** (e.g., *said Tom, asked Lily*) comes before, after, or in the middle of speech.  
5️⃣ **New line = new speaker.**

## 🧩 2. Common Speech Structures

### **a. Speech + Reporting Clause**
> “I can’t find my shoes,” said Ben.

**Comma** inside quotes; reporting clause outside.

---

### **b. Reporting Clause + Speech**
> Ben said, “I can’t find my shoes.”

Comma after reporting clause, before opening quote.

---

### **c. Split Speech**
> “I can’t find,” said Ben, “my shoes anywhere!”

Punctuation goes *inside* the quotes each time they open/close.

## 🧠 3. Punctuation Inside Speech Marks

| Type | Example | Rule |
|------|----------|------|
| **Statement** | “We’re late,” she said. | Comma before closing quote. |
| **Question** | “Are we late?” she asked. | Question mark inside quotes. |
| **Exclamation** | “Run!” shouted Dad. | Exclamation mark inside quotes. |
| **Interrupted** | “Run,” shouted Dad, “before it rains!” | Comma when continuing speech. |

## 💡 4. Paragraphing in Dialogue

Each **new speaker** starts on a **new line**, even if they only say a few words.

✅ *Example:*
> “Where are you going?” asked Lily.  
> “To the park,” replied Sam.  
> “Don’t forget your coat,” said Mum.

This helps readers track who is speaking.
