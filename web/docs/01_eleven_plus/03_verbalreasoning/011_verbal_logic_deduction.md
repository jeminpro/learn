# Verbal Logic & Deduction
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions test your ability to **draw logical conclusions** from short written statements.  
They are like mini puzzles where you must decide what is **true**, **false**, or **not stated** based purely on the information given — *not on outside knowledge*.

This is reasoning with **language logic**, not facts.

## 🧩 Common Types

| Type | Description | Example | Skill Tested |
|------|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **True / False / Not Stated** | Decide whether a statement is supported. | All cats are pets. Some pets are dogs. Are all cats dogs? → False | Deductive logic |
| **Syllogisms** | Deduce a conclusion from two facts. | All A are B. All B are C. Therefore all A are C. | Chain reasoning |
| **Inference / Deduction** | Spot what must be true or could be true. | If Ben is taller than Tim but shorter than Amy, who is tallest? → Amy | Relational reasoning |
| **Order & Comparison** | Work out sequences from clues. | Tom before Sam, Sam after Ben → order: Ben, Sam, Tom | Logical ordering |
| **Conditional (“If…then”)** | Apply logical rule. | If it rains, we stay inside. It rained. → We stayed inside. | Cause–effect logic |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Read Every Word Carefully**
GL traps you with words like *some*, *all*, *only*, *none*, *never* — these change the entire meaning.

Example:  
> All cats are pets.  
> Some pets are dogs.  
→ “Some cats are dogs”? ❌ *Not stated.*

---

### 2️⃣ **Underline Facts Given**
Turn each sentence into a mini rule.

> All apples are fruits.  
> Some fruits are red.  
→ All apples are red? ❌ *Not stated.*

---

### 3️⃣ **Apply Chain Logic**
If A > B and B > C → A > C.  
If All A are B and All B are C → All A are C.

---

### 4️⃣ **Reject Assumptions**
Don’t use outside knowledge — only what’s given.

> All cats have wings.  
> Tom is a cat.  
→ Does Tom have wings? ✅ *Yes, logically true in this made-up world.*

---

### 5️⃣ **Use Tables or Diagrams for Order Problems**
Helps visualise comparisons like:
> Ben taller than Tim, Amy taller than Ben → Amy > Ben > Tim.

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| Circle key words (*all, some, none, never, always*). | Avoids misreading. |
| Treat sentences as facts, even if they sound wrong. | GL tests logic, not reality. |
| For “not stated,” check that it isn’t clearly true or false. | Means information missing. |
| Make quick comparison chains for taller/shorter/faster. | Simplifies deduction. |
| Use elimination — only one statement will fully fit. | Saves time. |

## ✅ Answers & Explanations

| Q | Answer | Explanation |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **B (False)** | Dogs ⊂ Animals; cats separate group. |
| 2 | **C (Not Stated)** | We don’t know if any squares are circles. |
| 3 | **A (Amy)** | Amy > Ben > Tom. |
| 4 | **B (Picnic cancelled)** | Conditional rule: if it rains → cancelled. |
| 5 | **B (False)** | Only pens are blue, not all blue things are pens. |
| 6 | **B (No)** | Penguins = birds; no birds swim → penguins don’t. |
| 7 | **C (Sam)** | Order: Mark > Lucy > Sam → Sam youngest. |
| 8 | **B (Square)** | “If four sides then square” given as fact. |
| 9 | **C (Not Stated)** | Only some cats are black → we don’t know about all. |
| 10 | **A (Yes)** | All group members play football → Tom plays. |

## 🧭 Mastery Checklist

✅ Understands true/false/not stated logic  
✅ Can build comparison chains (taller, older, etc.)  
✅ Avoids using real-world assumptions  
✅ Solves quickly by focusing on fact words  

---

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Try a **“Logic Detective”** game:
1. Make 3 silly factual statements (e.g. *All apples are blue. Some blue things can sing.*).  
2. Ask short questions (*Can apples sing?*).  
3. Mark True / False / Not Stated.  

This turns **abstract logic into play**, helping your child internalise GL reasoning flow.
