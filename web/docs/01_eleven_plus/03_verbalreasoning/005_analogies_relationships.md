# Analogies & Relationships
---

## 🧠 Explanation

Analogy questions test your ability to see **relationships between pairs of words or letters**.  
You must find **how the first pair is connected**, then **apply the same logic** to complete or select the second pair.

They test:
- Vocabulary precision  
- Logical reasoning  
- Pattern recognition

## 🧩 Common Analogy Types

| Type | Description | Example | Rule |
|------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Word Meaning (Semantic)** | Relationship based on meaning | kitten : cat :: puppy : ? | Both are baby → adult → **dog** |
| **Opposite (Antonym)** | Words are opposites | hot : cold :: tall : short | Opposite meanings |
| **Synonym** | Same or similar meaning | happy : joyful :: sad : ? | **unhappy** |
| **Part → Whole** | Part of something | petal : flower :: leaf : tree | Part–whole |
| **Function** | Purpose or use | pen : write :: knife : cut | Object–function |
| **Degree / Intensity** | Strength of relationship | warm : hot :: cool : ? | **cold** |
| **Cause & Effect** | One leads to the other | rain : wet :: study : learn | Cause → result |
| **Letter Pattern** | Alphabetical position pattern | AB : CD :: EF : ? | +2 → **GH** |
| **Category / Type** | One example of a group | oak : tree :: rose : flower | Same category |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Find the Link**
Ask yourself:
- Are they **similar**, **opposite**, or **connected** somehow?
- Does one **cause** or **describe** the other?
- Is it a **category** or **function** relationship?

> Example: knife : cut  
→ What does a knife do? It cuts.  
→ So, hammer : ? → **hit**.

---

### 2️⃣ **Apply the Same Rule**
Use identical reasoning for the second pair.

> Kitten : Cat :: Puppy : ?  
Rule: baby → adult.  
→ Puppy → **Dog**.

---

### 3️⃣ **Check Options That Break the Rule**
Eliminate choices that fit a *different* type of relationship.

> hot : cold :: tall : short (both opposites)  
If one option isn’t opposite, discard it immediately.

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Works |
|------|--------------|
| **Say the relationship aloud** | Clarifies the rule quickly. |
| **Look for root type first** (synonym, antonym, function) | Most GL analogies use 5–6 basic rule types. |
| **Test both directions** (A→B and B→A) | Helps identify part/whole or cause/effect. |
| **Eliminate instantly** | 2 of 4 options are usually unrelated in meaning. |
| **Remember word pairs you’ve seen before** | GL repeats common analogy families (tool–action, young–adult). |

## 🎯 In Gloucestershire GL Exam

- Appears as **multiple-choice analogies**.  
- You may see:
  - “A is to B as C is to ?”  
  - “Which pair is related in the same way as the first?”  
  - Letter analogies like **AB : CD :: EF : ?**

**Core GL Focus Areas:**
- Word analogies (vocabulary + logic)
- Letter analogies (alphabet position patterns)
- Function & category relationships

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Play **“Word Pair Detective”**:
1. Give your child two words (e.g. *knife : cut*).  
2. Ask, “What connects them?”  
3. Then give a new word (*brush*) and see if they can find the matching pair (*paint*).  

Gradually mix word + letter analogies.  
This builds **automatic pattern detection**, essential for 11+ timing.
