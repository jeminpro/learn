# Odd One Out / Exceptions
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions test how well you can **spot the pattern or category** that connects a group of words or letter sets — and identify which one **doesn’t belong**.  

The odd one out is the word (or pair) that **breaks the rule** or **doesn’t share the same property** as the others.

## 🧩 Common Odd-One-Out Types

| Type | Description | Example | Rule |
|------|--------------|----------|------|
| **Meaning Category** | One word doesn’t belong in a group of similar meanings. | apple, banana, carrot, grape | Carrot = vegetable, others = fruit |
| **Opposite / Synonym Set** | Three are synonyms or opposites, one isn’t. | happy, joyful, sad, glad | Sad = opposite |
| **Letter Pattern** | One breaks the alphabet rule. | ACE, BDF, CEG, BEH | BEH doesn’t fit +2 pattern |
| **Word Form / Grammar** | One has different tense or type. | running, jumping, eat, swimming | “eat” is not -ing form |
| **Category Mix** | One doesn’t fit theme. | red, blue, triangle, green | Triangle = shape, others = colours |
| **Paired Relationship** | One pair doesn’t share the same connection. | pen:write, knife:cut, broom:sweep, spoon:sit | Spoon:sit breaks function rule |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Identify the common link**
Look for what 3 items have in common — not just what’s different.

Example:  
> cat, dog, horse, chair  
→ 3 are animals, 1 is not → **chair** is the odd one out.

---

### 2️⃣ **Check categories carefully**
Sometimes two belong to one group and two to another — find the strongest link.

Example:  
> red, green, blue, square  
→ First three are colours → **square** is odd.

---

### 3️⃣ **For letter or code sets**
Translate each into letter positions.

Example:  
> ACE (1,3,5), BDF (2,4,6), CEG (3,5,7), BEH (2,5,8)  
→ First three have +2 jumps; BEH jumps +3 → **BEH** odd one out.

---

### 4️⃣ **For word relationships**
If each word has a partner (like synonyms), test if one pair doesn’t fit.

> tall : short, big : small, heavy : light, cold : ice  
→ cold : ice isn’t opposite, so it’s odd.

## ⚡ Tips to Work Fast

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| **Find the “rule of three.”** | If 3 share one clear feature, 4th is odd. |
| **Use quick mental categories.** | Animal, colour, verb, noun, tool, etc. |
| **Alphabet patterns?** | Write letter positions below each. |
| **Eliminate distractors first.** | GL includes near-misses to waste time. |
| **Don’t overthink — one clear reason is enough.** | 1 logical difference = correct answer. |

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Play **“Odd One Out Speed Round”**:
1. Say four words aloud quickly (e.g. *cat, dog, horse, table*).  
2. Give 3 seconds to find the odd one and explain why.  
3. Add letter groups for extra challenge (*ACE, BDF, BEH, CEG*).  

This strengthens **category recognition** and **verbal speed**, both vital for GL timing.
