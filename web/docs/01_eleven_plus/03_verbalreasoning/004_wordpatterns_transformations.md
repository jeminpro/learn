# Word Patterns & Transformations
---

## 🧠 Explanation

These questions test how well you can **spot patterns and manipulate words or letters** logically.  
They often involve rearranging, adding, or removing letters to form new words.

It’s a mix of **word reasoning + spelling knowledge + quick observation** — a key part of GL Verbal Reasoning.

## 🧩 Common Types

| Type | What It Involves | Example | Skill Tested |
|------|------------------|----------|---------------|
| **Complete the Word** | Fill in missing letter(s) | CA_ → CAT | Vocabulary recall |
| **Jumbled Letters / Anagrams** | Rearrange to form a real word | RAT → ART, TAR | Visual memory |
| **Move a Letter** | Move 1 letter to make 2 real words | MEAT → TEAM | Logical adjustment |
| **Hidden Words** | Find hidden word inside a phrase | The ca**TAPE**stry → TAPE | Pattern spotting |
| **Word Chains / Transformations** | Change one letter at a time to make new words | COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD | Stepwise logic |

## 🧮 How to Solve Step by Step

### 1️⃣ **Spot What’s Fixed**
In most puzzles, one or more letters are fixed (either at the start or end).  
Work around them.

Example:  
> CA_ → Options: CAT, CAP, CAN, CAR  
→ Which makes sense in context or matches clues?

---

### 2️⃣ **For Anagrams**
- Count the letters first.  
- Rearrange systematically, not randomly.  
- Use familiar prefixes (*un-, re-, dis-*) and endings (*-ed, -ing, -ion*).  
- Look for common letter pairs: **TH, CH, SH, ST, ER**.

Example:  
> RAEHT → EARTH / HEART  
Always check all possibilities — GL questions may use either.

---

### 3️⃣ **For “Move a Letter”**
These are trickier — one letter must be removed from one word and placed in another.

Example:  
> HEAR + T → HEART (both valid words).  
Tip: Try shifting vowels first — they usually form the link.

---

### 4️⃣ **For Hidden Words**
Look inside the sentence carefully; ignore spacing.

Example:  
> “The cat sat on the mat.” → hidden word “at” occurs twice.

Scan overlapping pairs of 3–4 letters:
- CAT, ATS, TSO, SON, etc.

---

### 5️⃣ **For Word Chains**
One letter changes at a time, forming a real word each step.

Example:  
> COLD → CORD → CARD → WARD  

Tips:
- Only **one letter** changes per step.  
- All intermediate words must exist.  
- Visualise letter positions (1–4).

## ⚡ Quick Tips

| Tip | Why It Helps |
|------|---------------|
| Circle fixed letters | Stops confusion when rearranging. |
| Use a vowel-consonant balance | Most real words alternate vowels and consonants. |
| For anagrams, rearrange in order: vowels → consonants → check pattern | Fast and reliable. |
| Spot short words hidden inside longer ones first. | Common GL trick. |
| Always read result aloud — real words sound right. | “Ear feel” confirms correctness. |

## 🎯 In Gloucestershire GL Exam

- Appears in **Verbal Reasoning Paper 1 or 2**  
- Always **multiple-choice**.  
- May appear as:
  - “Which word completes the pattern?”  
  - “Which word can be made from these letters?”  
  - “Find the hidden word in this sentence.”  
  - “Change one letter at a time to reach the final word.”

You’ll need **strong vocabulary recall** and **quick pattern recognition**.

### 💬 Teaching Idea
Play a **“Letter Detective”** game:
1. Write 5 mixed words on paper (e.g. *tca, atb, rhea, cold*).  
2. Give 30 seconds to find real words.  
3. Score 1 point for each correct, +1 if they can explain how they found it.  

Then progress to **move-a-letter** challenges — fast-paced, perfect for building word logic fluency.
