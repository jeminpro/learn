# Multiplying and dividing decimals

### 📘 Explanation:

**Big idea:**
Multiplying and dividing decimals is like working with whole numbers — you just need to keep track of **how many digits come after the decimal point**.

When you multiply, **the number gets larger** (unless you multiply by a decimal smaller than 1).
When you divide, **the number gets smaller** (unless you divide by a decimal smaller than 1).

### ⚙️ Multiplying decimals — step by step

1. **Ignore the decimal points** and multiply as if they were whole numbers.
2. **Count total decimal places** in both numbers.
3. **Place the decimal point** in the answer so that it has that many decimal places.

**Example 1:**
0.6 × 0.4 = ?
→ Multiply 6 × 4 = 24
→ There are **2 decimal places** in total (1 from each number).
→ Answer = 0.24.

**Example 2:**
1.2 × 3 = ?
→ Multiply 12 × 3 = 36
→ There’s **1 decimal place** (from 1.2) → 3.6.

**Example 3:**
0.25 × 8 = ?
→ 25 × 8 = 200
→ 2 decimal places → 2.00 = 2.

**Common mistakes:**

* Forgetting to count decimal places.
* Treating 0.6 × 0.4 as 2.4 (wrong — it becomes smaller, not larger).
* Writing extra zeros incorrectly.

### ⚙️ Dividing decimals — step by step

#### Case 1: Divide by a whole number

Just divide normally and **bring the decimal point straight up**.

**Example:**
4.8 ÷ 2 = 2.4
Think “48 tenths ÷ 2 = 24 tenths = 2.4.”

#### Case 2: Divide by a decimal

Make the divisor (the number you’re dividing by) a **whole number** by multiplying both numbers by 10, 100, etc.

**Example:**
6 ÷ 0.3 = ?
→ Multiply both by 10 → 60 ÷ 3 = 20.
→ So 6 ÷ 0.3 = 20.

**Example:**
2.4 ÷ 0.6 = ?
→ Multiply both by 10 → 24 ÷ 6 = 4.
→ Answer = 4.

**Common mistakes:**

* Forgetting to move the decimal in both numbers.
* Dividing the wrong way (flipping the divisor).

### 🪙 Everyday analogies:

* **Multiplying by 0.1** is like taking a tenth. Example: 5 × 0.1 = 0.5.
* **Dividing by 0.1** is like asking “how many tenths in 5?” → 50.
* **Multiplying by 10** moves digits one place left (number gets 10 times bigger).
* **Dividing by 10** moves digits one place right (number gets 10 times smaller).

### 🧮 Examples:

1. 0.5 × 0.2 = 0.10
   (5 × 2 = 10 → 2 decimal places)

2. 1.6 × 4 = 6.4

3. 2.5 × 0.3 = 0.75

4. 4.8 ÷ 0.6 = 8

5. 0.72 ÷ 0.9 = 0.8

6. 6 ÷ 0.2 = 30

7. 0.48 ÷ 0.4 = 1.2

8. 0.25 × 16 = 4

**Common mistake check:**
If you multiply by something less than 1, the result should get smaller (not bigger).
If you divide by something less than 1, the result should get bigger.
