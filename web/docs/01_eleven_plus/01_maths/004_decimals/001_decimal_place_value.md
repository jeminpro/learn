# Decimal place value

### 📘 Explanation:

**Big idea:** A decimal is a number with a dot (decimal point) that separates **wholes** from **parts**.
Think of a **money tray** or a **place-value street**:

* To the **left** of the decimal point are houses for **ones, tens, hundreds**…
* To the **right** are flats for **tenths, hundredths, thousandths**…

Each step to the **left** is 10 times bigger. Each step to the **right** is 10 times smaller.

```
Hundreds | Tens | Ones . Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths
     3        4      2 .     7          0             5
   = 300   +  40   +  2 +  0.7       + 0.00        + 0.005
```

* **Tenths** (0.1) are like **10p coins** if a whole pound is 1.
* **Hundredths** (0.01) are like **1p coins**.
* **Thousandths** (0.001) are even smaller slices.

**Reading decimals:**

* 3.4 is “three and four tenths”.
* 0.06 is “six hundredths”.
* 2.705 is “two and seven hundred five thousandths”.

**Writing value of a digit:**

* In 5.83, the **8** is in the tenths place → value = 0.8.
* In 0.406, the **6** is in the thousandths place → value = 0.006.

**Zeroes and placeholders:**

* 0.5 = 0.50 = 0.500 (same amount, different precision).
* Leading zero before the point helps readability: write **0.7**, not **.7**.

**Comparing decimals:**
Line up the decimal points; compare place by place:

* 3.47 vs 3.5 → compare tenths: 0.4 < 0.5, so 3.47 < 3.5.
* If tenths same, compare hundredths, then thousandths, etc.

**Rounding (preview):**
To round to tenths, look at hundredths:

* 3.46 → 3.5 (because the 6 hundredths rounds the 4 tenths up).
* 2.43 → 2.4 (because the 3 hundredths keeps the 4 tenths the same).

**Number line sense:**
Between 2 and 3:

* 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 … split the space into 10 equal parts (tenths).
* Between 2.3 and 2.4, hundredths like 2.31, 2.32… split again into 100 parts in total.

**Expanded form (decimal):**
4.205 = 4 + 0.2 + 0.005.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Place value table and value of a digit**
   Number: 6.304

* Ones = 6
* Tenths = 3 → value 0.3
* Hundredths = 0 → value 0
* Thousandths = 4 → value 0.004
  **Common mistake:** Saying the 3 is “3 hundredths”. It’s in tenths, so it’s 0.3, not 0.03.

2. **Write in words / read accurately**

* 0.09 → “nine hundredths” (not “nine tenths”).
* 5.70 → “five and seventy hundredths” (same amount as 5.7).
  **Common mistake:** Ignoring zero in the middle (0.09 is not 0.9).

3. **Compare and order**
   Order from smallest to largest: 3.8, 3.58, 3.805
   Line them up to three decimal places:

* 3.800, 3.580, 3.805 → smallest is 3.58, then 3.8, then 3.805.
  **Common mistake:** Thinking more digits means bigger. Compare place by place.

4. **Number line estimation**
   Place 2.47 on a 2 to 3 number line.

* 2.4 is 4 tenths; 2.47 is 7 hundredths more, so just under halfway between 2.4 and 2.5.
  **Common mistake:** Treating 2.47 like “2 and 47 tenths” (it’s 47 hundredths).

5. **Expanded form and reconstructing**
   Write 7 + 0.02 + 0.004 as a single number.

* Ones 7, hundredths 0.02, thousandths 0.004 → 7.024.
  **Common mistake:** Misplacing digits → writing 7.204 by accident. Keep the columns straight.

### ✅ Answers:

1. 0.6 (six tenths).

2. 4.5 (tenths: 0.5 > 0.45).

3. 7 tenths.

4. 0.5 (equal to 0.50).

5. 2.01, 2.1, 2.10.

6. Hundredths (value 0.08).

7. Just a little past one-fifth of the way from 5 to 6.

8. 8.34.

9. 5.98 (difference to 6 is 0.02 vs 0.2).

10. Any digit 0–9 works except 0, because 4.00 is not greater than 3.99; so 4.01–4.09 → missing digit 1–9.

11. 15 tenths (1.5 = 15 tenths).

12. 7 hundredths (0.07 = 7/100).

13. 2.35 is greater; tenths equal (3), hundredths 0 vs 5 → 5 is larger.

14. 6 + 0.4 + 0.00 + 0.002.

15. 0.909, 0.9, 0.899, 0.89 (compare tenths, then hundredths, then thousandths).

16. Yes, equal; trailing zero doesn’t change value.

17. Missing digit 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9 (7.23 < 7.2_3 < 7.3 for those digits).

18. 60 cm (0.6 × 100).

19. 0.205, 0.25, 0.502, 0.52.

20. 95.40 (place 9 then 5 before the point, then .40; no leading zero needed).

21. Monday 3.2 km has hundredths digit 0; Tuesday 3.02 has hundredths 2 → Tuesday’s hundredths digit (2) is larger.

22. £2.47 is more; difference £0.063 (2.470 − 2.407).

23. 4.658 (digit 6). Distances to 4.6:

* 4.658 → 0.058
* 4.558 → 0.042
* 4.758 → 0.158, etc. Closest is **4.558** actually (digit 5) with distance 0.042. **Correct digit = 5**.

24. 5.678 → nearest tenth is 5.7; the hundredths digit (7) decides to round tenths up.
25. 0.80 and 0.800 (also 0.8000, etc.).
26. 0.375 → 3 tenths (0.3), 7 hundredths (0.07), 5 thousandths (0.005).
27. Incorrect. Compare place by place: 0.507 vs 0.57 → tenths equal (0.5), hundredths 0 vs 7 → 7 is larger, so 0.57 > 0.507. More digits doesn’t mean larger.
28. 2.036 (smallest whole digit first is 2, then decimal point, then smallest order 0, 3, 6).
29. 2.500 is the midpoint of 2.49 and 2.51; between the two options, 2.495 is closer to the middle than 2.505 (2.495 is 0.005 from 2.500; 2.505 is 0.005 above too—both are equally spaced! Trick: **both are equally close**, but the exact middle is 2.50).
30. 7.454: tenths 4; between 7.45 and 7.46; hundredths twice thousandths → 5 = 2 × 2.5 doesn’t work with a digit; try thousandths 2, hundredths 4: 2×2=4 fits, number 7.442 is too low; thousandths 5, hundredths 10 invalid; thousandths 2, hundredths 4 with tenths 4 gives 7.442 (not between 7.45 and 7.46). Correct fit: thousandths 3, hundredths 6 (6 = 2 × 3), tenths 4 → 7.463 is between 7.45 and 7.46. **Answer: 7.463**.
