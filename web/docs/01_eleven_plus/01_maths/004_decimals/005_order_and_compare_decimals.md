# Order and compare decimals

### 📘 Explanation:

**Big idea:**
When comparing or ordering decimals, **line up the decimal points** and **compare each place value** from left to right — just like whole numbers.
The **further left** a digit is, the **more it matters**.

Example:
3.75 vs 3.8
→ Compare whole numbers: both 3.
→ Compare tenths: 7 vs 8 → 8 is greater.
→ So 3.8 is larger.

### 🧩 Place value reminder:

| Place       | Example number: 4.537 | Value |
| ----------- | --------------------- | ----- |
| Ones        | 4                     | 4     |
| Tenths      | 5                     | 0.5   |
| Hundredths  | 3                     | 0.03  |
| Thousandths | 7                     | 0.007 |

Each digit to the right of the decimal is **ten times smaller** than the one before it.

### 🧮 Steps to compare decimals:

1. **Write them vertically**, aligning decimal points.
2. **Add zeros** so they have the same number of decimal places (e.g. 3.4 → 3.40).
3. **Compare digits** from left to right until one is greater.
4. If all are the same → the numbers are equal.

### 🪙 Everyday examples:

* **Money:** £3.50 is more than £3.45.
* **Distance:** 1.25 m is longer than 1.2 m.
* **Marks:** 9.75/10 is higher than 9.5/10.

### 💡 Comparing decimals on a number line:

A number line helps visualise where decimals lie.

Example:
Between 0 and 1,

* 0.4 = 4 tenths
* 0.45 = halfway between 0.4 and 0.5
* 0.49 is closer to 0.5.

So 0.4 &lt; 0.45 &lt; 0.49 &lt; 0.5.

---

### ⚠️ Common mistakes:

* Thinking 0.53 &lt; 0.5 because “53 &lt; 5” (forgetting place value).
* Forgetting trailing zeros don’t change value (0.6 = 0.60 = 0.600).
* Comparing by number of digits, not value. (0.125 &lt; 0.8 even though it has more digits).

---

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Compare 0.45 and 0.5**
   → Line up: 0.45 vs 0.50 → 5 > 4 → 0.5 is greater.

2. **Order 3.6, 3.56, 3.605**
   → Equalise digits: 3.60, 3.56, 3.605 → smallest to largest: 3.56, 3.6, 3.605.

3. **Compare 2.09 and 2.9**
   → 2.09 = two and nine hundredths; 2.9 = two and nine tenths.
   → 2.9 is much greater.

4. **Compare 0.7, 0.65, 0.705**
   → 0.65 &lt; 0.7 &lt; 0.705.

5. **Equal numbers**
   → 4.3 = 4.30 = 4.300 — same value.
