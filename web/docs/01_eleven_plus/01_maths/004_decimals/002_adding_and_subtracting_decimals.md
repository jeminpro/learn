# Adding and subtracting decimals

### 📘 Explanation:

**Big idea:**
Adding and subtracting decimals works just like whole numbers — but you must keep the **decimal points lined up** so that each place value (ones, tenths, hundredths, etc.) stays in the correct column.

Think of money:
If £3.75 + £2.4 = ?, you’d line up the pounds and pence properly, just like stacking coins by type.

```
   £3.75
+  £2.40
---------
   £6.15
```

Notice how we wrote **2.40**, not 2.4, to keep the tenths and hundredths lined up.
Adding or subtracting decimals is **column addition** with careful alignment.

#### 💡 Steps to add or subtract decimals:

1. **Write the numbers in columns** — line up the decimal points.
2. **Fill in missing places** with zeros if needed (e.g. 2.4 → 2.40).
3. **Add or subtract as usual**, starting from the rightmost digits.
4. **Bring the decimal point straight down** into your answer.

---

#### 🪙 Everyday analogy:

* Adding decimals = adding parts of pounds or metres.
  For example, £1.25 + £2.40 means 1 pound 25p + 2 pounds 40p.
* Subtracting decimals = finding the difference between amounts.
  If something costs £5.00 and you pay £6.25, the change is £1.25.

---

#### ⚠️ Common mistakes:

* Forgetting to line up decimal points.
* Ignoring zeros that help with place values (2.4 ≠ 2.40 in column layout).
* Treating the decimal point like a digit and moving it around.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Add decimals with different lengths**

   ```
   3.7 + 2.45 = ?
     3.70
   + 2.45
   ------
     6.15
   ```

   Always write both numbers with two decimal places to align properly.

2. **Subtract decimals**

   ```
   8.2 – 3.75 = ?
     8.20
   - 3.75
   ------
     4.45
   ```

   Borrow if needed (as in normal subtraction).

3. **Add three decimals**

   ```
   1.25 + 0.6 + 2.35 = ?
     1.25
   + 0.60
   + 2.35
   ------
     4.20
   ```

   Decimal points stay in a straight column.

4. **Word-style (money example)**
   Mia buys an apple for £0.65 and a drink for £1.30.
   Total = £0.65 + £1.30 = £1.95.
   **Common mistake:** Saying £0.65 + £1.3 = £1.95 (fine), but forgetting the 0 may cause misalignment on paper.

5. **Subtracting across a decimal**
   A car travels 5.6 km and then 1.85 km less the next day.
   Distance = 5.6 - 1.85 = 3.75 km.
   Add trailing zero to make 5.60 first, then subtract.
