# Order and Compare Numbers

### 📘 Explanation:

**What does it mean to order and compare numbers?**
To **compare numbers** means to find out **which number is greater, smaller, or equal**.
To **order numbers** means to **arrange** them from **smallest to largest** (ascending order) or **largest to smallest** (descending order).

Think of it like lining up people by height — you compare who’s taller or shorter, then arrange them in order.

### **How to Compare Whole Numbers**

1. **Look at the number of digits.**
   The number with **more digits** is larger.
   e.g. 5,230 &gt; 985

2. **If the same number of digits,** compare **from left to right**.
   e.g. Compare 4,682 and 4,729 → thousands same (4), hundreds same (6), tens: 8 vs 2 → 8 &gt; 2 → 4,682 &gt; 4,629

3. Use comparison symbols:

   * **&gt;** means “greater than”
   * **&lt;** means “less than”
   * **=** means “equal to”

   Example: 320 &lt; 350

### **How to Compare Decimal Numbers**

Compare digit by digit from **left to right**:

* Whole number part first
* Then tenths, hundredths, thousandths

Example:
3.56 vs 3.65 → whole numbers equal (3) → compare tenths: 5 vs 6 → 3.56 &lt; 3.65

**Tip:** Add zeros to make decimals have the same number of digits (e.g. 3.5 = 3.50).

### **Ascending and Descending Order**

* **Ascending** = smallest → largest
  Example: 12, 45, 78
* **Descending** = largest → smallest
  Example: 78, 45, 12

---

**Common Mistakes:**

* Looking at digits without thinking of their place value (e.g. thinking 56 &lt; 103 because 5 &lt; 1).
* Comparing decimals incorrectly (e.g. thinking 3.8 &lt; 3.56 because 56 looks larger — always align place values!).

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Compare 843 and 834.
   → Both 3 digits → Compare hundreds: 8 = 8 → tens: 4 vs 3 → **843 &gt; 834**

2. Which is greater: 7,305 or 7,350?
   → Same thousands and hundreds → compare tens: 0 vs 5 → **7,305 &lt; 7,350**

3. Order in ascending order: 0.5, 0.45, 0.54
   → 0.45, 0.5, 0.54

4. Which is smaller: 6.08 or 6.8?
   → Compare tenths: 0 vs 8 → **6.08 &lt; 6.8**

5. Arrange 3,202, 2,320, 3,220 in descending order.
   → 3,220, 3,202, 2,320
