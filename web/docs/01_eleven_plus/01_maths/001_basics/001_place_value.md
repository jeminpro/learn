# Place Value

### 📘 Explanation:

**What is Place Value?**
Place value tells us **how much each digit in a number is worth** based on its **position**.

Think of each digit like a person sitting in a specific seat in a theatre — the *seat number* decides their *role*.
For example, in 3,582:

* The **2** is in the **ones** place → worth **2**
* The **8** is in the **tens** place → worth **80**
* The **5** is in the **hundreds** place → worth **500**
* The **3** is in the **thousands** place → worth **3,000**

Together, they make **3,582** = 3000 + 500 + 80 + 2.

Each time you move **one place to the left**, the value becomes **10 times bigger**.
Each time you move **one place to the right**, it becomes **10 times smaller**.

**Place Value Chart (Whole Numbers)**

| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
| --------- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| 3         | 5        | 8    | 2    |
| 3000      | 500      | 80   | 2    |

**Place Value Chart (Decimals)**

| Ones | Tenths | Hundredths | Thousandths |
| ---- | ------ | ---------- | ----------- |
| 4    | 7      | 2          | 5           |
| 4    | 0.7    | 0.02       | 0.005       |

So **4.725** = 4 + 0.7 + 0.02 + 0.005.

**Key Points:**

* Value increases ×10 when moving left (tens, hundreds, thousands)
* Value decreases ÷10 when moving right (tenths, hundredths)
* Zero is a **placeholder** to show empty places (e.g. 507 means 5 hundreds and 7 ones — no tens)

**Common Mistakes:**

* Thinking the *digit* itself changes instead of its *value*.
  E.g. in 45 and 405, the 5 means 5 ones in both — but the zero changes the 4’s position and makes it 400.
* Forgetting that decimal digits are **smaller than one**, not whole numbers.
