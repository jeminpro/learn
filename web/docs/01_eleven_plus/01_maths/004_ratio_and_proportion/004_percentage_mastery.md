# Percentage Mastery — How to Teach Every Concept

Percentages in 11+ cover **4 big skill groups**:

1️⃣ **Find a percentage of a number**

2️⃣ **Find what percentage one number is of another**

3️⃣ **Reverse percentages (original price/quantity before change)**

4️⃣ **Percentage increase & decrease (single and repeated)**

Teach them in this order because each step supports the next.

# ✅ **1. Finding a Percentage of a Number**

(E.g., 80% of 90, 75% of 16, 99% of 200)

### **Core idea to teach**

Percent means **“per 100”**.

So:
**x% of a number = (x/100) × number**

But DO NOT start with the formula. Start with **building blocks**:

### **Teach these mental anchors first**

| Percentage | What it means  | Shortcut        |
| ---------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| **50%**    | Half           | ÷2              |
| **25%**    | Quarter        | ÷4              |
| **75%**    | Three quarters | ×3 then ÷4      |
| **10%**    | One tenth      | ÷10             |
| **1%**     | One hundredth  | ÷100            |
| **5%**     | Half of 10%    | (÷10 then ÷2)   |
| **20%**    | Double 10%     | 2 × (÷10)       |
| **30%**    | Triple 10%     | 3 × (÷10)       |
| **80%**    | 100% − 20%     | whole minus 20% |
| **99%**    | 100% − 1%      | whole minus 1%  |

Once they know these, they can solve any % mentally.

### **Teaching technique**

For **80% of 90**
👉 Teach: Find 10%, multiply as needed, subtract if easier.

For **75% of numbers**
👉 Teach: “Find quarter first, then ×3.”

For **99% of numbers**
👉 Teach: “Find 1% then subtract.”

For awkward numbers (e.g., 45% of 300)
👉 Teach **split percentages**:
45% = 40% + 5%

Students should practice breaking percentages into chunks they know.

# ✅ **2. What Percentage Is One Number of Another?**

(E.g., 5 is what % of 20? What % of 60 is 12?)

### **Core idea**

**Part ÷ whole × 100**

But again: don’t start with formula — start with meaning:

### **Teaching method**

1. Draw a bar model.
2. Shade the “part.”
3. Ask: *What fraction is shaded?*
4. Convert the fraction to a percentage.

Example method (without solving your exact numbers):

* If a number fits exactly into the other, turn it into a **simple fraction** first.
* Then convert that to percentage using known facts:

| Fraction | Percentage |
| -------- | ---------- |
| 1/2      | 50%        |
| 1/4      | 25%        |
| 1/5      | 20%        |
| 1/10     | 10%        |
| 1/20     | 5%         |
| 1/100    | 1%         |

### **Technique to teach**

* When the numbers are small and friendly → use fractions first.
* When numbers are not simple → do **part ÷ whole × 100**.

This concept allows them to answer:
✔ "What percentage of 100 is 50?"
✔ "What percentage of 80 is 8?"
✔ "What percentage of 60 is 12?"

All with the same method.

# ✅ **3. Reverse Percentages**

(E.g., *After a 20% decrease the price is £72. What was original?*)

This is the BIGGEST exam trap.

### **Core idea**

If something *decreases by X%*, the final amount represents:

| Decrease | Final value is… |
| -------- | --------------- |
| 10% off  | 90% of original |
| 20% off  | 80% of original |
| 30% off  | 70% of original |

For an increase:

| Increase | Final value is…  |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| 10% up   | 110% of original |
| 25% up   | 125% of original |
| 50% up   | 150% of original |

### **Teach this golden method**

“Find the percentage the final amount represents, THEN divide.”

Example structure (not solving your question):
If after 25% increase the final is 125,
→ final is **125%** of original
→ original = final ÷ 1.25 (or ÷ 125% in fraction terms)

We teach:

1. **Convert the remaining percentage to decimal.**
2. **Divide the final number by that decimal.**

This solves all reverse % questions.

---

# ✅ **4. Percentage Increase & Decrease**

(E.g., reduce 100 by 20%, then 10%; increase 150 by 30% then reduce 20%)

Teach **two approaches**:

---

## **A. Method 1: Change amount**

Useful for simple numbers.

Example pattern:

To reduce by 20%:

1. Find 20%
2. Subtract from original

To increase by 25%:

1. Find 25%
2. Add to original

---

## **B. Method 2: Multipliers (VERY powerful for GL)**

Once they learn this, problems become 1-step.

### **Teach this chart**

| Operation       | Multiplier |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| Increase by 10% | ×1.10      |
| Increase by 20% | ×1.20      |
| Increase by 25% | ×1.25      |
| Decrease by 10% | ×0.90      |
| Decrease by 20% | ×0.80      |
| Decrease by 40% | ×0.60      |
| Decrease by 30% | ×0.70      |

### **Why teach multipliers?**

Because repeated changes are NOT additive.

Example structure (not solving yours):

* Reduce by 10% then 10% is **not 20% total** — it’s ×0.9 ×0.9.

Your examples:

* Reduce 500 by 10%, then another 10%
* Increase 150 by 30%, then reduce by 20%
* Reduce 100 by 20%, then by 10%

All become easy using multipliers.

# ✅ **5. Word Problems: Percentages in Real Life Contexts**

(E.g., students in a school, discounts, price changes)

### Teach a 3-step strategy

### **Step 1: Identify the whole.**

Is the whole 300 students? The original price? The final price?

### **Step 2: Identify the percentage relationship.**

Is it “are boys”?
Is it “absent”?
Is it “off”?
Is it “increased to”?
Is it “reduced to”?

### **Step 3: Apply one of the core techniques:**

* Find a percentage of a number
* Reverse percentage
* Percentage increase/decrease
* Part-whole percentage

Word problems exist only to check whether the child knows **which concept to apply**.

---

# 🎯 **Summary of What to Teach**

### **Concept 1: Percent of a number**

* 10%, 1%, 50%, 25%, 5%, 20%
* Splitting %: 45% = 40% + 5%
* Complementary %: 80% = 100% − 20%

### **Concept 2: Percentage that one number is of another**

* Part ÷ whole × 100
* Fraction-to-percent shortcuts

### **Concept 3: Reverse percentages**

* Final amount after increase/decrease
* Use division by multiplier (key skill)

### **Concept 4: Percentage change**

* Increase or decrease
* Use multipliers
* Repeated % changes are NOT additive

### **Concept 5: Word problems**

* Identify whole
* Identify whether it’s increase, decrease, proportion, or reverse %
* Choose correct method

# ✅ **MEDIUM (16–35)**

16. **48**
    40% = 4 × 10% → (120 ÷ 10) × 4

17. **130**
    65% = 50% + 10% + 5%
    100 + 20 + 10

18. **9**
    15% = 10% + 5% → 6 + 3

19. **99**
    99% = whole − 1% → 100 − 1

20. **28**
    35% = 30% + 5%

21. **20%**
    12⁄60 = 1⁄5 → 20%

22. **25%**
    10⁄40 = 1⁄4 → 25%

23. **150**
    30 is 20% → whole = 30 ÷ 0.20

24. **300**
    45 is 15% → whole = 45 ÷ 0.15

25. **25%**
    24⁄96 = 1⁄4 → 25%

# ✅ **HARD (36–50)**

(Reverse % and repeated changes)

36. **£90**
    Final is 80% → 72 ÷ 0.8

37. **100**
    Final is 125% → 125 ÷ 1.25

38. **£100**
    Final is 70% → 70 ÷ 0.7

39. **80**
    Final is 115% → 92 ÷ 1.15

40. **£300**
    Final is 88% → 264 ÷ 0.88

41. **72**
    100 → 20% off → 80
    80 → 10% off → 72
    (or ×0.8 ×0.9)

42. **156**
    150 × 1.3 = 195
    195 × 0.8 = 156

43. **405**
    500 × 0.9 × 0.9 = 405

44. **330**
    240 × 1.25 = 300
    300 × 1.10 = 330

45. **99 (not original)**
    ×0.9 then ×1.1 → 0.99 of original → 99

46. **216 boys**
    55% girls → 45% boys → 480 × 0.45

47. **43 meals**
    18% of 240 = 43.2 → 43 meals (GL rounds down to whole meals)

48. **90 marks**
    72 is 80% → 72 ÷ 0.8

49. **£54**
    20% of 45 = 9 → 45 + 9

50. **£16.20**
    25% off 24 → 24 × 0.75 = 18
    10% off 18 → 18 × 0.9 = 16.20
