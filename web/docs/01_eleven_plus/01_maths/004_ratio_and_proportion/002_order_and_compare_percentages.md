# Order & Compare Percentages

### 📘 Explanation:

**What is a percent?**
A **percent** means “out of 100”.

* 30% = 30 out of 100 squares in a 100-square grid.
* 0.3 = 30% (move the decimal 2 places).
* (\frac{3}{10} = 30%) (because (\frac{3}{10} = \frac{30}{100})).

**Why ordering percentages matters**
In the 11+ you’ll often decide which is bigger, smaller, or best value. Sometimes you compare **pure percentages** (e.g., 35% vs 0.38) and sometimes **percentages of different totals** (e.g., 20% of 150 vs 25% of 120). Always check if the **whole is the same**.

**Core ideas and quick tools**

1. **Convert to the same form**

   * Between **percent ↔ decimal**: divide/multiply by 100.

     * 47% → 0.47, 0.62 → 62%
   * Between **fraction ↔ percent**: make denominator 100 or use a known benchmark.

     * (\frac{1}{4}=25%), (\frac{3}{5}=60%), (\frac{2}{3}\approx66.7%)

2. **Benchmarks help**

   * 25% = quarter, 50% = half, 75% = three qcd uarters, 10% = one tenth.
   * Use them to judge quickly (e.g., 48% is just under half).

3. **Same whole vs different wholes**

   * If **same whole** (e.g., same class size), compare the percent directly.
   * If **different wholes** (e.g., different class sizes), turn each percent **into an amount** first (e.g., 30% of 80 = 24).

4. **Ordering a list**

   * Convert everything to **percent** (or all to decimals), then sort.

**Common mistakes to avoid**

* ❌ Comparing 30% of 80 with 25% of **a different number** by only looking at 30 vs 25.
  ✅ Find the **actual amounts** first.
* ❌ Mixing up decimal and percent sizes (thinking 0.6 < 50% because 0.6 “looks small”).
  ✅ 0.6 = 60% which is bigger than 50%.
* ❌ Forgetting the % sign changes meaning (0.4 ≠ 0.4%).
  ✅ 0.4 = 40%, but 0.4% = 0.004 in decimal.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Compare simple percentages (same whole)**
   Which is larger: **47%** or **0.46**?

* Convert 0.46 → 46%.
* Compare 47% vs 46% → **47% is larger**.

2. **Order a mixed list**
   Order **0.32**, **35%**, **(\frac{1}{3})** from smallest to largest.

* 0.32 = 32%
* 35% = 35%
* (\frac{1}{3} \approx 33\frac{1}{3}%)
  → **32% < 33⅓% < 35%** (so 0.32, 1/3, 35%).

3. **Compare percent of different totals**
   Which is more: **30% of 80** or **25% of 96**?

* 30% of 80 = (0.30 \times 80 = 24)
* 25% of 96 = (\frac{1}{4} \times 96 = 24)
  → **Equal**.

4. **Best discount**
   Which is the bigger saving on a £60 jacket: **15% off** or **£8 off**?

* 15% of £60 = (0.15 \times 60 = £9)
* £9 vs £8 → **15% off is better**.

5. **Interpreting “nearly half”**
   Two classes took a quiz. In Class A, **49%** passed; in Class B, **(\frac{1}{2})** passed.

* 49% vs 50% → Class B has the higher pass rate.
* If class sizes differ, the **number** of passes could still differ, but the **rate** (percentage) is higher in B.

### ✅ Answers:

1. **40%** (40% > 39%).

2. **49%** (0.52 = 52%, so 49% is smaller).

3. **1/5, 0.28, 25%** (1/5=20%, then 28%, then 25% → actually 25% < 28%; smallest to largest: 20%, 25%, 28%).

4. **True** (0.7 = 70%).

5. **48%** (closer to 50% than 43%).

6. **31%** is bigger (3/10 = 30%).

7. **13%, 1/8, 0.12** from largest to smallest → 13% (largest), 1/8=12.5%, 0.12=12%.

8. **92%** (92% > 89%).

9. **74%, 0.76, 3/4** from smallest to largest → 74%, 76%, 75% → correct order is **74%, 3/4, 0.76** (since 3/4=75%).

10. **40%** (0.405 = 40.5%, so 40.5% > 40%; larger is 0.405).

11. **Equal** (35% of 60 = 21; 30% of 70 = 21).

12. **Asha** (£10 vs £9).

13. **Class with 45% of 40**: 0.45×40=18; **3/8 of 32**: 12; → **Class of 40**.

14. **12% off** (£9.60 vs £9).

15. **Team Red** (0.62 = 62% > 61%).

16. 2/5 of 90 = 36; 39% of 100 = 39 → **39% of 100** is bigger.

17. 55% of 2L = 1.1L; 0.52 of 2.1L = 1.092L → **55% of 2L**.

18. Hall A: 1/4 of 400 = 100; Hall B: 24% of 420 = 100.8 (~101 tickets’ worth) → **Hall B** (by ~1 ticket).

19. Both 60 pupils: 70% of 60 = 42; 0.68×60 = 40.8 (~41) → **Year 5**.

20. Compare rates: 47% vs 1/2 = 50% → **1/2 of 140** (70) vs 47% of 150 (70.5) → **47% of 150** (by 0.5).

21. **Shop Y**.

    * Shop X: £50 → 10% off = £45 → 20% off = £36.
    * Shop Y: 28% off £50 = £36.
      They tie here (£36). For general prices, sequential 10% then 20% equals 28% off (not 30%).

22. Class A: 60% of 35 = 21; Class B: (2/3) of 28 ≈ 18.67 → **Class A by 2–3 pupils** (exactly by 2.33; since pupils are whole, A has **21 vs 19** if rounding B to nearest whole).

23. Morning: 5/8 = 62.5%; Afternoon: 62% → **Morning** by 0.5 percentage points.

24. Week 1: 25% = quarter; Week 2: 1/5 = 20% → **Week 1** bigger saving.

25. 30% of 180 = 54; (2/3) of 80 = 53⅓ → **30% of 180**.

26. 0.37 = 37%; 9/25 = 36% → **Apples by 1 percentage point**.

27. Half of the larger level (10% larger) = 0.5×1.10 = **55%** of the original level amount; 48% vs 55% → **Half of larger level** gives more progress.

28. 45% of 640 = 288; 7/15 of 540 = 252 → **School with 640**.

29. **Not the same as 25% off once**.

    * £100 → 15% off = £85 → 10% off = £76.50 (total 23.5% off).
    * 25% off once = £75.
      So two-step is **less** than 25% off.

30. **Offer C**.

    * A: 30% off £90 = £63.
    * B: £20 off → £70.
    * C: 10% off → £81; then 20% off → £64.80.
      Lowest is **£63 (A)** vs **£64.80 (C)** vs **£70 (B)** → Correction: **Offer A** is best.

> **Teacher tips (for this topic):**
> • Encourage pupils to **convert everything to percent** first when ordering.
> • For different totals, **compute the amounts** before comparing.
> • Use **benchmarks** (25%, 50%, 75%) for quick estimates, then refine if needed.
> • Watch out for **sequential discounts** and the idea that “percent of a percent” multiplies, not adds.
