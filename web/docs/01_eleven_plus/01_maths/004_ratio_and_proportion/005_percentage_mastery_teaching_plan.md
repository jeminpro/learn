# Percentage Mastery - Teaching Plan

Structured in **5 stages**, taught over **6–10 weeks**, depending on pace.

---

# 📘 **Stage 1 — Build the Foundations (Week 1–2)**

### 🎯 Objectives

✔ Understand what a percentage means
✔ Connect fractions, decimals, and percentages
✔ Memorise key “anchor percentages”

### 🧠 Concepts to teach

1. **Percent = out of 100**
   Use 100 squares, grids, shaded diagrams.

2. **Link fractions ↔ decimals ↔ percentages**

* ½ = 0.5 = 50%
* ¼ = 25%
* ¾ = 75%
* 1⁄10 = 10%
* 1⁄20 = 5%

3. **Teach “anchor percentages”:**

* 50% → half
* 25% → quarter
* 75% → 3 quarters
* 10% → divide by 10
* 1% → divide by 100
* 5% → half of 10%

🎓 **Year-4 skill target:**
Your child should be able to find
**10%, 1%, 5%, 50%, 25%, 75%** of simple numbers.

# 📘 **Stage 2 — Find a Percentage of a Number (Week 2–3)**

### 🎯 Objectives

✔ Use anchors to find any percentage
✔ Break percentages into friendly parts
✔ Solve typical GL “Find x% of…” problems

### 🧠 Concepts to teach

1. **Use anchors first**
   E.g., 60% of 50 = 50% + 10%
   E.g., 35% of 200 = 30% + 5%

2. **Break difficult percentages**

* 48% = 50% − 2%
* 99% = 100% − 1%
* 15% = 10% + 5%

3. **Model with bar diagrams**

4. **Introduce formula gently (optional at first):**
   [
   x%  of N = (x/100) x N
   ]

🎓 **Year-5 readiness target:**
Your child should confidently solve questions like:

* 30% of 150
* 75% of 16
* 99% of 200
* 45% of 300

# 📘 **Stage 3 — Percent as “Part of a Whole” (Week 3–4)**

### 🎯 Objectives

✔ Find what % one number is of another
✔ Understand percentages as “fractions of 100”
✔ Manage word problems involving ratios and parts

### 🧠 Concepts to teach

1. **Use fraction first (most intuitive for kids):**
   Example structure:
   “What percentage of 80 is 8?” → 8/80 = 1/10 → **10%**

2. **Teach the formula:**   
   Percentage = (part/whole) x 100

3. **Use bar models**
   Shaded part → percentage of whole.

4. Practise real-world problems:

* “32% of the class is absent.”
* “What % of the apples were eaten?”

🎓 **Year-5 readiness target:**
Your child should solve questions like:

* 5 is what % of 20?
* 12 is what % of 60?
* What % of 96 is 24?

# 📘 **Stage 4 — Percentage Increase, Decrease & Multipliers (Week 4–6)**

### 🎯 Objectives

✔ Understand % changes
✔ Perform increases and reductions
✔ Use multipliers for quick repeated changes
✔ Handle money-based questions (GL favourite)

### 🧠 Concepts to teach

## **A. Simple % change**

* Increase by 20% → find 20%, then add
* Decrease by 15% → find 15%, then subtract

Start with easy numbers, then scale.

---

## **B. Multipliers (most powerful GL technique)**

Introduce when confident:

| Change | Multiplier |
| ------ | ---------- |
| +10%   | ×1.10      |
| +20%   | ×1.20      |
| +25%   | ×1.25      |
| -10%   | ×0.90      |
| -20%   | ×0.80      |
| -30%   | ×0.70      |

Repeated changes → multiply again
(Explain why two 10% decreases ≠ 20%.)

---

## **C. Word Problems:**

* Shop discounts
* School data
* Price rises
* Successive changes (VERY common)

🎓 **Year-5 readiness target:**
Able to solve:

* Increase £120 by 30%
* Reduce 200 by 15%
* Reduce 100 by 20%, then by 10%
* Increase 150 by 30%, then decrease by 20%

---

# 📘 **Stage 5 — Reverse Percentages (Week 6–8)**

### 🎯 Objectives

✔ Find original amounts after increase/decrease
✔ Work with “reduced to”, “increased to”, “after discount”
✔ Prepare for hardest GL questions

### 🧠 Concepts to teach

## **A. Core idea:**

If something decreases by 20%, the final value is **80%** of the original.
If it increases by 25%, the final value is **125%** of the original.

## **B. Method to teach:**

Always **divide** by the multiplier.

Examples pattern:

* “After 20% off, the price is £72.”
  → 72 ÷ 0.8

* “After a 25% increase, the value is 125.”
  → 125 ÷ 1.25

Use bar models to make the idea visual (critical for children).

🎓 **Goal:**
Child can solve all common GL reverse % questions.

# 📘 **Stage 6 — Mixed Practice & Exam Training (Week 8–10)**

### 🎯 Objectives

✔ Blend all skills
✔ Build speed & accuracy
✔ Reduce errors from misreading

### 🧠 Tasks to include

### **A. Mixed timed sets**

Use 10–12 questions in 10 minutes.

### **B. Multi-step problems**

E.g.,

* Reduce by 20%, then increase by 10%
* Find x% of a number, then find what % that answer is of another

### **C. Misleading phrasing practice**

Common GL tricks:

* “Reduced to” vs “reduced by”
* “35% were absent” → remaining students
* “45% more than” vs “45% of”

### **D. Estimate before calculating**

Ask child to guess the ballpark answer to prevent slips.

# 📘 **Ongoing Revision Plan**

### Every week:

* 10 quick % of a number
* 5 % increase/decrease
* 2 reverse percentage
* 5 word problems

### Every month:

* 1 mini mock test
* 1 exam simulation under timed conditions
