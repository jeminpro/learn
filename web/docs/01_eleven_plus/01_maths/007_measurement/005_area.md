# 🟩 Area

### 📘 Explanation:

**Area** measures the *amount of space inside a shape*.
It tells us **how much surface** a shape covers — for example, the space on a floor, wall, or piece of paper.

Imagine **painting**, **covering with tiles**, or **spreading grass seed** — that’s measuring area!

### 🧩 Key Ideas

| Shape               | Formula                                                     | Example                                      |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| **Square**          | Area = side × side                                          | If side = 6 cm → 6 × 6 = 36 cm²              |
| **Rectangle**       | Area = length × width                                       | If l = 8 cm, w = 3 cm → 8 × 3 = 24 cm²       |
| **Triangle**        | Area = ½ × base × height                                    | If b = 10 cm, h = 6 cm → ½ × 10 × 6 = 30 cm² |
| **Parallelogram**   | Area = base × height                                        |                                              |
| **Compound shapes** | Split into rectangles, find each area, then add or subtract |                                              |

**Area units:**

* cm² (square centimetres)
* m² (square metres)
* mm², km², etc.
  Each unit means a *square* of that side length.

### 🟦 Area Conversion Quick Facts

| From → To         | Multiply / Divide  |
| ----------------- | ------------------ |
| 1 m² = 10,000 cm² | ×10,000 or ÷10,000 |
| 1 cm² = 100 mm²   | ×100 or ÷100       |

Because each side is ×10, and **area** involves two dimensions → 10 × 10 = 100.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* Confusing **perimeter** (distance around) with **area** (space inside).
* Forgetting to use **square units** (writing “cm” instead of “cm²”).
* Using **slanted sides** instead of **base and height** in triangles.
* Forgetting to convert all measurements to the **same unit**.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Find the area of a rectangle:**
   Length = 9 cm, Width = 4 cm
   → 9 × 4 = **36 cm²**

2. **Find the area of a square:**
   Side = 5 cm
   → 5 × 5 = **25 cm²**

3. **Find the area of a triangle:**
   Base = 8 cm, Height = 5 cm
   → ½ × 8 × 5 = **20 cm²**

4. **A rectangular field 12 m × 10 m:**
   → 12 × 10 = **120 m²**

5. **A compound shape:**
   Two rectangles:
   (4 m × 3 m) + (2 m × 3 m) = 12 + 6 = **18 m²**
