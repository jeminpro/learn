# ⚖️ Metric Units

### 📘 Explanation:

**Metric units** are the *standard way to measure length, mass (weight), and capacity (volume)* in most of the world — including the UK for school maths and science.

Metric measurements are **based on 10s**, so conversions are simple — you multiply or divide by powers of **10**, **100**, or **1000**.

### 🧩 Main Metric Units

#### **Length**

| Unit       | Symbol | Relation      |
| ---------- | ------ | ------------- |
| millimetre | mm     | 10 mm = 1 cm  |
| centimetre | cm     | 100 cm = 1 m  |
| metre      | m      | 1000 m = 1 km |

#### **Mass (Weight)**

| Unit     | Symbol | Relation              |
| -------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| gram     | g      | 1000 g = 1 kg         |
| kilogram | kg     | 1000 kg = 1 tonne (t) |

#### **Capacity (Volume)**

| Unit       | Symbol | Relation              |
| ---------- | ------ | --------------------- |
| millilitre | ml     | 1000 ml = 1 litre (l) |

### 🟩 Converting Units

To convert **smaller → larger**, **divide** (because larger units are fewer).
To convert **larger → smaller**, **multiply**.

Example:

* 5 m = 500 cm (×100)
* 3000 g = 3 kg (÷1000)
* 2.5 l = 2500 ml (×1000)

### 🧮 Example Table

| Conversion  | Calculation | Answer |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------ |
| 3 km → m    | 3 × 1000    | 3000 m |
| 450 cm → m  | 450 ÷ 100   | 4.5 m  |
| 2.4 kg → g  | 2.4 × 1000  | 2400 g |
| 750 ml → l  | 750 ÷ 1000  | 0.75 l |
| 1500 m → km | 1500 ÷ 1000 | 1.5 km |

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* Mixing **mass** and **capacity** (g ≠ ml).
* Forgetting to multiply or divide by the right **power of 10**.
* Writing conversions without **unit labels**.
* Treating 1 litre as 100 ml (it’s 1000 ml).

### 🧮 Examples

1. Convert 3.5 m to cm → 3.5 × 100 = **350 cm**
2. Convert 2500 ml to litres → 2500 ÷ 1000 = **2.5 l**
3. Convert 4.2 kg to g → 4.2 × 1000 = **4200 g**
4. Convert 7500 g to kg → 7500 ÷ 1000 = **7.5 kg**
5. Convert 2.8 km to m → 2.8 × 1000 = **2800 m**
