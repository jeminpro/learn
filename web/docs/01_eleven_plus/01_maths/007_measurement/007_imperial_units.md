# ⚖️ Imperial Units

### 📘 Explanation:

Before metric units became standard, people in the UK used **imperial units** to measure length, mass (weight), and capacity (volume).
You’ll still see them **in everyday life** — like measuring body weight in *stones and pounds*, or distance in *miles*.

So, it’s important to understand both **imperial units** and how they **relate to metric units**.

### 🧩 Common Imperial Units

#### **Length**

| Unit                    | Equivalent | Metric Equivalent (approx.) |
| ----------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 1 inch (in)             | 2.54 cm    | —                           |
| 1 foot (ft) = 12 inches | 30 cm      |                             |
| 1 yard (yd) = 3 feet    | 0.91 m     |                             |
| 1 mile = 1760 yards     | 1.6 km     |                             |

#### **Mass (Weight)**

| Unit                 | Equivalent | Metric Equivalent (approx.) |
| -------------------- | ---------- | --------------------------- |
| 1 ounce (oz)         | —          | 28 grams                    |
| 1 pound (lb) = 16 oz | —          | 0.45 kg                     |
| 1 stone = 14 lb      | —          | 6.35 kg                     |

#### **Capacity (Volume)**

| Unit               | Equivalent      | Metric Equivalent (approx.) |
| ------------------ | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| 1 pint             | 20 fluid ounces | 568 ml                      |
| 1 gallon = 8 pints | —               | 4.5 litres                  |

### 🟦 Converting Between Imperial and Metric

You often need to **estimate or convert** between the two systems.

| Conversion | Approximate Equivalent |
| ---------- | ---------------------- |
| 1 inch     | 2.5 cm                 |
| 1 foot     | 30 cm                  |
| 1 yard     | 0.9 m                  |
| 1 mile     | 1.6 km                 |
| 1 lb       | 0.45 kg                |
| 1 pint     | 0.57 l                 |

👉 **Tip:**
Use **rounded conversions** for mental maths unless accuracy is required.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes

* Forgetting how many smaller units make up a larger one (e.g., 16 oz in 1 lb).
* Mixing metric and imperial without converting first.
* Forgetting that **UK pint ≠ US pint** (UK pint is slightly larger).
* Confusing **mass (kg)** with **volume (litres)**.

### 🧮 Examples

1. 3 ft = 3 × 30 = **90 cm**
2. 5 miles ≈ 5 × 1.6 = **8 km**
3. 2 lb = 2 × 0.45 = **0.9 kg**
4. 3 pints = 3 × 0.57 = **1.71 litres**
5. 1 stone = 14 lb = 14 × 0.45 = **6.3 kg**
