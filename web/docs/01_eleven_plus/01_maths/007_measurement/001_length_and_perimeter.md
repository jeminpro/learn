# 🧮 Length & Perimeter

### 📘 Explanation:

**Length** tells us *how long something is*.
We use it every day — when measuring the height of a child, the distance we walk, or the length of a pencil.

In Maths, **length** is measured using **standard units** such as:

* **millimetres (mm)** – very small (like the thickness of a coin)
* **centimetres (cm)** – for short objects (like a book or pencil)
* **metres (m)** – for longer things (like a room or garden)
* **kilometres (km)** – for long distances (like roads or journeys)

👉 **Conversion tips:**

* 10 mm = 1 cm
* 100 cm = 1 m
* 1000 m = 1 km

So to **convert smaller to larger units**, divide (because you need fewer bigger units).
To **convert larger to smaller units**, multiply.

### 🟩 **Perimeter**

The **perimeter** means the *total distance around the outside of a shape*.
Imagine walking around the edge of your garden — that’s the perimeter!

It is found by **adding up all the side lengths**.

#### For different shapes:

* **Rectangle / Square:**
  Perimeter = 2 × (Length + Width)

* **Triangle:**
  Perimeter = a + b + c (sum of all sides)

* **Regular polygon (all sides equal):**
  Perimeter = Number of sides × Length of one side

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* Forgetting to **add all sides**, especially when some are missing or equal.
* Mixing up **area and perimeter** (area measures space inside, perimeter is the boundary).
* Not converting all measurements into the **same unit** before calculating.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Find the perimeter of a rectangle**
   Length = 8 cm, Width = 3 cm
   → Perimeter = 2 × (8 + 3) = 2 × 11 = **22 cm**

2. **Find the perimeter of a square**
   Side = 6 cm
   → Perimeter = 4 × 6 = **24 cm**

3. **Find the perimeter of a triangle**
   Sides = 5 cm, 7 cm, 9 cm
   → Perimeter = 5 + 7 + 9 = **21 cm**

4. **A garden is 20 m long and 10 m wide.**
   How far will a dog run if it goes once around the garden?
   → 2 × (20 + 10) = **60 m**

5. **A playground fence has 4 equal sides of 15 m each.**
   Total fencing needed = 4 × 15 = **60 m**

16. Width = 6 m, Length = 12 m
17. 80 m × 2 = 160 m
18. 5 – 2×(1.5 + 1) = 5 – 5 = 0 m (no rope left)
19. 35 cm
20. 7 cm
21. Width = 10 cm, Length = 15 cm
22. Width = 8 cm
23. Width = 30 m, Length = 50 m
24. Outer side = 8 + 2×1 = 10 → Perimeter = 40 m
25. One lap = 2×(90+60)=300 m → 5 laps = 1500 m
