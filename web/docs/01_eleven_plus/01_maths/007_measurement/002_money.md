# 💷 Money

### 📘 Explanation:

Money is a way of showing **value** — it tells us how much something **costs** or how much we **have**.
In the UK, we use **pounds (£)** and **pence (p)**.

* 100 pence = £1
* 1 pound = 100 pence

You can write:

* £2.50 (read as *two pounds fifty*)
* 250p means the same as £2.50

We often work with **decimals** when using pounds and pence.
For example:
£3.75 = 3 pounds + 75 pence

### 🧩 Key Concepts:

#### 🟩 Adding and Subtracting Money

Use column addition or subtraction, just like with decimals.
Always **align the decimal points** (pounds and pence).

#### 🟨 Multiplying and Dividing

Use these when calculating **total cost** or **cost per item**.
Example:
If 1 apple costs 35p, 6 apples cost 6 × 35p = 210p = £2.10

#### 🟦 Making Change

Subtract the cost from the amount given.
Example:
If you pay £5 for something costing £3.40 → £5.00 – £3.40 = £1.60 change

#### 🟪 Estimating Money

Round prices to the nearest pound to estimate totals quickly.

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* Forgetting to convert all to **same units** (mixing pence and pounds incorrectly).
* Misplacing the **decimal point**.
* Forgetting that **£1 = 100p**.
* Subtracting smaller amount from bigger the wrong way round when finding change.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Add:** £2.50 + £3.75 = £6.25
2. **Subtract:** £10.00 – £4.60 = £5.40
3. **Multiply:** 6 notebooks at £1.25 each → 6 × £1.25 = £7.50
4. **Divide:** £8 shared between 4 friends → £8 ÷ 4 = £2 each
5. **Find change:** Paid £20 for goods costing £14.85 → Change = £5.15
