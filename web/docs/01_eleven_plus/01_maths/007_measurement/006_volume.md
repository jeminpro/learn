# 🧊 Volume

### 📘 Explanation:

**Volume** measures *how much space a 3D object takes up* — or how much it can hold.

It’s like counting **how many cubes fit inside** a box!

> 💡 Think of volume as the “space inside” a container — like how much water fills a bottle or how much air fits inside a balloon.

### 🧩 Key Ideas

#### **Units of Volume**

| Unit                 | Used For          | Relation      |
| -------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| cubic centimetres    | (cm³)             | small objects |
| cubic metres         | (m³)              | large spaces  |
| 1 m³ = 1,000,000 cm³ | —                 |               |
| 1 litre (l)          | same as 1000 cm³  |               |
| 1 ml = 1 cm³         | exact equivalence |               |

### 🟩 Volume Formulas

| Shape                          | Formula                        | Example            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------ | ------------------ |
| **Cube**                       | side × side × side             | 4³ = 64 cm³        |
| **Cuboid (Box)**               | length × width × height        | 6 × 3 × 2 = 36 cm³ |
| **Prism (same cross-section)** | area of cross-section × length | —                  |

**Tip:**
All sides must be in the **same unit** before calculating.

### 🟦 Estimating Volume

* A small mug: about **250 ml (250 cm³)**
* A bottle of water: about **1 litre (1000 cm³)**
* A washing machine drum: about **60 litres**
* A classroom: about **50 m³**

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes

* Forgetting to multiply **all three dimensions**.
* Mixing cm³ and ml incorrectly.
* Using **perimeter** or **area** formulas instead of **volume**.
* Forgetting to convert cm → m when needed.

### 🧮 Examples

1. A cube has sides 5 cm long.
   → Volume = 5 × 5 × 5 = **125 cm³**

2. A cuboid has dimensions 10 cm × 6 cm × 4 cm.
   → Volume = 10 × 6 × 4 = **240 cm³**

3. A box 2 m × 3 m × 4 m.
   → Volume = 24 m³

4. A container holds 2000 cm³ of juice.
   → Volume = **2 litres**

5. A cube has volume 64 cm³.
   → Side = ³√64 = **4 cm**
