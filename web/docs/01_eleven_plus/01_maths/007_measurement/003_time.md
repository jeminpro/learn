# ⏰ Time

### 📘 Explanation:

**Time** tells us *when things happen* and *how long they take*.
We measure time in **seconds (s)**, **minutes (min)**, **hours (h)**, **days**, **weeks**, **months**, and **years**.

### 🟦 Reading the Clock

#### **Analogue clock**

* The **short hand** shows **hours**.
* The **long hand** shows **minutes**.
* Each small mark = 1 minute.
* When the long hand points at **3**, it’s **15 minutes past** the hour.
* When it points at **9**, it’s **15 minutes to** the next hour.

#### **Digital clock**

* Shown as **HH:MM** (e.g. 07:45 means 7:45).
* In **24-hour format**, add 12 to any time after midday:

  * 2:30 pm → 14:30
  * 11:15 pm → 23:15

### 🟩 Calculating Time

To find **elapsed time** (the time between two moments):

1. Start from the earlier time.
2. Count forward in hours, then minutes.
3. Or convert both times to minutes and subtract.

---

### 🚫 Common Mistakes

* Mixing **am** and **pm**.
* Forgetting there are **60 minutes in an hour**, not 100.
* Miscounting across **midnight or noon**.
* Confusing **start time** and **end time** when subtracting.

### 🧮 Examples

1. A lesson starts at 9:00 am and ends at 9:45 am.
   → Duration = **45 minutes**.

2. A film starts at 6:30 pm and ends at 8:15 pm.
   → Duration = 1 hour 45 minutes.

3. A train leaves at 14:20 and arrives at 17:05.
   → Duration = 2 hours 45 minutes.

4. If school ends at 15:30 and the bus takes 25 minutes, you reach home at **15:55**.

5. There are **24 hours × 60 minutes = 1440 minutes** in a day.
