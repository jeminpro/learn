# 📈 Line Graphs

### 📘 Explanation:

A **line graph** shows how something **changes over time** or how two quantities are **connected**.
Each **point** represents a piece of data, and the points are **joined by straight lines** to show a pattern or trend.

Line graphs are often used for **temperatures**, **sales over months**, or **distances over time**.

---

### 🔹 Key ideas

* The **horizontal axis (x-axis)** usually shows **time** (days, months, years).
* The **vertical axis (y-axis)** shows the **amount or value** being measured.
* Each **point (x, y)** marks a pair of values — for example, (Monday, 12 °C).
* You can **connect** the dots to see how the data rises, falls, or stays steady.
* You can compare two sets of data by using **two different lines**, often with a key.

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

* Forgetting to check **axis scales** — sometimes they go up in 2s, 5s, or 10s.
* Mixing up **x** and **y** values.
* Assuming the line between points means “every value in between” — it only shows *the trend*.
* Reading from the wrong axis label.

### 🧮 Examples:

#### Example 1 – Temperature change

| Day              | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri |
| :--------------- | --: | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Temperature (°C) |  10 |  12 |  15 |  13 |  11 |

If you plot these and join them:

* Temperature **rises** from Mon → Wed.
* Then it **falls** slightly by Fri.
  This shows a gentle “hill” shape on the graph.

#### Example 2 – Reading from a line

If the line passes through (2 pm, 50 km) and (4 pm, 90 km):
Distance increase = 90 − 50 = **40 km** over 2 hours → speed = 20 km/h.

---

#### Example 3 – Comparing two lines

A blue line shows **Tom’s score** and a red line shows **Lily’s**.
At 10 am, Tom = 12 pts, Lily = 15 pts → Lily ahead by 3.
At 12 pm, Tom = 20, Lily = 18 → Tom overtook her.

---

#### Example 4 – Interpreting trends

If the line keeps rising → data increasing.
If it’s flat → no change.
If it falls → data decreasing.

---

#### Example 5 – Predicting

If you see 10, 15, 20, 25 … you might **predict** the next will be 30, but only if the pattern continues logically.
