# 🖼️ Pictograms

### 📘 Explanation:

A **pictogram** (or picture graph) shows information using **pictures or symbols** instead of numbers.
Each picture stands for a **certain number of items** — for example, one apple symbol might represent **2 fruits**.

Pictograms help you **see patterns and compare quantities quickly** — great for spotting “which is most” or “how many more”.

### 🔹 Key ideas

* Each picture or symbol has a **key** that tells you what it means (e.g. 🍪 = 5 cookies).
* Sometimes you’ll see **half** or **quarter** pictures — that means half or quarter of the value in the key.
* To **find totals**, multiply the number of pictures by what each picture represents.
* To **compare**, look for differences in picture counts or total values.
* Always **read the key carefully** — it’s the most common place where mistakes happen!

### 🧮 Examples:

#### Example 1 — Reading a pictogram

| Animal            | 🐶 | 🐱 | 🐰  | 🐦 |
| :---------------- | :- | :- | :-- | :- |
| Number of symbols | 4  | 3  | 2 ½ | 1  |

**Key:** 🐾 = 2 pets

→ Dogs = 4 × 2 = 8 pets
→ Cats = 3 × 2 = 6 pets
→ Rabbits = 2.5 × 2 = 5 pets
→ Birds = 1 × 2 = 2 pets

✅ Total = 21 pets

#### Example 2 — Interpreting a half symbol

Each 🍎 = 4 apples

| Basket   | 🍎🍎🍎½ | 🍎🍎🍎🍎 | 🍎🍎½ |
| :------- | :------ | :------- | :---- |
| Basket A |         |          |       |
| Basket B |         |          |       |
| Basket C |         |          |       |

* Basket A = 3.5 × 4 = 14 apples
* Basket B = 4 × 4 = 16 apples
* Basket C = 2.5 × 4 = 10 apples

➡ Basket B has the most apples.

#### Example 3 — Making your own pictogram

A shop sold 20, 10 and 30 ice creams (vanilla, strawberry, chocolate).
If 1 🍦 = 5 ice creams:

| Flavour    | 🍦 count     |
| :--------- | :----------- |
| Vanilla    | 🍦🍦🍦🍦     |
| Strawberry | 🍦🍦         |
| Chocolate  | 🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦🍦 |

#### Example 4 — Missing value

If 1 🚲 = 3 bicycles and the pictogram shows 5 🚲 = 15 bicycles,
then 2 🚲 = 6 bicycles.
To make 24 bicycles, draw 8 🚲.

---

#### Example 5 — Common mistake

**Mistake:** forgetting the key.
If you count 4 pictures thinking each = 1 item (when the key says = 2),
you’ll get half the correct answer!

#### 🔺 Hard

21. Each 🎒 = 5 bags. A shop sold 45 bags in total. If the pictogram shows 3 full and 1 half symbols for blue bags, how many are other colours?

15. 25 pupils
16. 3/5 roses
17. 4 more
18. 20 hours
19. 7 symbols
20. 4 symbols

#### 🔺 Hard

21. (3.5 × 5 = 17.5 ≈ 18 bags blue) → 45 – 18 = 27 other bags
22. Silver = 4.8 ≈ 5 symbols
23. Mean = (12 + 20 + 18)/3 = 16.7 cartons
24. 15 full symbols
25. Friend’s symbol = 15 ÷ 4 = 3.75 points
26. Amy = 6 symbols (3 × 2 = 6 balloons) Tom = 12 balloons → 6 symbols
27. Missing = (45 ÷ 5) – (3 + 2 + 0.5) = 9 – 5.5 = 3.5 symbols
28. Others = 78 – 24 = 54 → 54 ÷ 6 = 9 symbols
29. 5.25 × 8 = 42 berries
30. (3.5 × 7) + (4 × 7) = 24.5 + 28 = 52.5 ≈ 52 → no symbols for erasers needed
