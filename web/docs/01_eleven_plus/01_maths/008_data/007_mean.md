# ⚖️ Mean (Average)

### 📘 Explanation:

The **mean** (also called the **average**) is a way to find a single value that represents a whole set of numbers.
It tells you what each number *would be* if everything were shared equally.

👉 Think of it like **sharing sweets equally** among friends.

### 🔹 Key ideas

* **Mean = Total of all numbers ÷ How many numbers there are**
* It’s affected by *every* number in the group — big or small.
* Works best when all data is similar in type (marks, prices, ages, etc.).
* Often used to compare performance or trends.

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

* Forgetting to divide by the correct count.
* Adding numbers incorrectly.
* Mixing up *mean* with *median* or *mode*.

### 🧮 Examples

#### Example 1 – Simple mean

Marks: 6, 8, 10
Total = 24
Number of marks = 3
Mean = 24 ÷ 3 = **8**

---

#### Example 2 – Adding another value

If another mark (12) is added → new total = 36
New mean = 36 ÷ 4 = **9**

---

#### Example 3 – Missing number

If 3 test scores have mean = 10, total = 3×10 = 30
If two scores are 8 and 12, the missing one = 30 − (8+12) = **10**

---

#### Example 4 – Real-life

Five children’s pocket money: £4, £6, £6, £8, £6
Total = £30 → Mean = £30 ÷ 5 = **£6**

---

#### Example 5 – Trick example

If one very large number is added (called an **outlier**), it can pull the mean up or down.
e.g. 4, 5, 6, 100 → mean = (115 ÷ 4) = **28.75**, even though most are small!

#### 🔺 Hard

21. 4×10=40 → 40−6= **34**
22. 5×20=100 → others = 100−30=70 → 70÷4 = **17.5**
23. (60+80+100)/3=80 → add 60: total=300, mean=300÷4= **75**
24. (4+5+6+7+x)/5=6 → 22+x=30 → **x = 8**
25. (10+20+30+40+50+x)/6=30 → 150+x=180 → **x = 30**
26. Total=4×9=36 → +12 = 48 → new mean = 48÷4 = **12**
27. Total=8×12=96 → remove 8 → 88÷7 = **12.57**
28. Total=5×10=50 → +15 = 65 → mean = 65÷6 = **10.83**
29. Total=3×7=21 → +13 = 34 → mean = 34÷4 = **8.5**
30. 10×140=1400 → +150 = 1550 → mean = 1550÷11 = **140.9 cm**
