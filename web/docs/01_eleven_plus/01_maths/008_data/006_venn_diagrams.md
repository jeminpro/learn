# 🔵 Venn Diagrams

### 📘 Explanation:

A **Venn diagram** shows how **groups (sets)** of things are related — using **overlapping circles**.
Each circle represents a group, and where circles **overlap**, that area shows items that belong to **both groups**.

It’s a great way to visualise **shared**, **unique**, and **total** information.

---

### 🔹 Key ideas

* Each **circle = one group (set)**.
* The **overlap** = items that belong to **both groups**.
* The **outside area** = items not in any group.
* In a **3-circle Venn diagram**, some parts may belong to **two or even all three groups**.
* You can count, compare, or find missing totals using Venn logic.

---

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

* Double-counting items in the overlap.
* Forgetting to include “neither” group.
* Mixing up what each circle stands for.
* Not checking if the question asks for “only”, “both”, or “neither”.

---

### 🧮 Examples

#### Example 1 – Two circles

| Group    | Meaning                |
| :------- | :--------------------- |
| Circle A | Children who like dogs |
| Circle B | Children who like cats |

If 5 children like both, 8 only dogs, and 7 only cats:
→ Total = 8 + 7 + 5 = **20 children**

---

#### Example 2 – Adding “neither”

If 20 pupils took part in a survey:

* 8 like chocolate only
* 6 like vanilla only
* 4 like both
  Then 8 + 6 + 4 = 18
  → 2 pupils like **neither**.

---

#### Example 3 – Finding the overlap

If 10 like red, 12 like blue, and 4 like both:
→ Total = 10 + 12 − 4 = **18**
(Remember to subtract the overlap once — it’s counted twice otherwise!)

---

#### Example 4 – Three-circle logic (concept only)

If you have sets A, B, C (e.g. **Maths**, **Science**, **English**):

* Some pupils may be in A∩B (both Maths & Science)
* Some in B∩C, or all three
* You always start filling from the **centre** outward.

---

#### Example 5 – “Only” vs “Both”

If 5 pupils like **only** apples and 3 like **both** apples & bananas:
→ Apple circle = 5 + 3 = **8 pupils total in that circle**

### ✅ Answers

#### 🔹 Easy

1. 8 + 6 − 4 = 10
2. 10 + 7 − 3 = 14
3️. 15 + 10 − 5 = 20
4️. 6 + 4 + 2 = 12
5️. 25 − 5 = 20
6. 8 − 5 = 3
7. 8 − 4 = 4
8. 9 − 3 = 6
9. (10 − 5) + (15 − 5) = 15
10. 16 − 4 = 12

#### 🔸 Medium

11. 40 − (15 + 10 + 5) = 10
12. (12 − 5) + (10 − 5) = 12
13. 8 + 12 + 5 = 25
14. 100 − (40 + 30 − 20) = 50
15. 20 + 10 + 5 = 35
16. 10 + 15 − 5 = 20
17. 28 − (8 + 10 + 4) = 6
18. 40 − (12 + 15 + 5) = 8
19. 12 + 10 + 6 = 28
