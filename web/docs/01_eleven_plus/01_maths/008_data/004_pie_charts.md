# 🥧 Pie Charts

### 📘 Explanation:

A **pie chart** shows data as **parts of a whole**, using **slices of a circle**.
Each slice represents a **category**, and its **size** depends on how much it contributes to the total.
The whole circle = **100% or 360°**.

Pie charts are great for showing **proportions** and **comparisons** between parts.

---

### 🔹 Key ideas

* The entire circle = 360°.
* Each slice’s angle = (category ÷ total) × 360°.
* You can also think in percentages:

  * Half = 50% = 180°
  * Quarter = 25% = 90°
  * One fifth = 20% = 72°
* To find a number from a pie chart, use the **total** and **fraction** (e.g. ¼ of 40 = 10).
* Always **check the key** or labels — some charts use percentages, others use angles.

---

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

* Forgetting that the circle = 360°, not 100° or 400°.
* Confusing **angle** and **percentage**.
* Adding slices incorrectly — total must always equal 360° (or 100%).
* Assuming all slices are drawn to scale without checking.

### 🧮 Examples

#### Example 1 – Converting data to angles

A survey of 60 students:

| Favourite Sport | Football | Tennis | Cricket | Swimming |
| :-------------- | -------: | -----: | ------: | -------: |
| Number          |       30 |     15 |       9 |        6 |

To find angle for football:
→ (30 ÷ 60) × 360 = 180°
Tennis: (15 ÷ 60) × 360 = 90°
Cricket: (9 ÷ 60) × 360 = 54°
Swimming: (6 ÷ 60) × 360 = 36°
✅ Total = 360°

#### Example 2 – Reading a pie chart

If a slice is labelled **90°**, it represents **¼ of the total** (because 90° ÷ 360° = ¼).
So if total = 80 students → ¼ × 80 = 20 students.

---

#### Example 3 – From percentages to numbers

A pie chart shows:

* Red = 25%
* Blue = 50%
* Green = 25%

If total = 200 marbles:
Red = 50, Blue = 100, Green = 50.

#### Example 4 – Comparing slices

If Music = 120° and Sports = 60°, then Music is **twice as popular** (120 ÷ 60 = 2).

---

#### Example 5 – Checking totals

If a pie chart has slices 90°, 120°, 60°, and 90°,
add them: = 360° → ✅ balanced chart.
If not = 360°, something’s missing!
