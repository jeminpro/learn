# 📊 Bar Charts

### 📘 Explanation:

A **bar chart** shows data using **bars (rectangles)** to represent quantities.
Each bar’s **height or length** tells you *how much* or *how many* something has.

It’s one of the easiest ways to **compare groups or categories**.

---

### 🔹 Key ideas

* Each bar stands for a category — like *favourite fruit* or *pets owned*.
* Bars can be **vertical** (up-and-down) or **horizontal** (sideways).
* The **scale** on the axis tells you what each line or step means (1, 2, 5, 10, etc.).
* Bars should be **equal width** and **not touching** (unlike histograms).
* Always label:

  * The **x-axis** (category)
  * The **y-axis** (quantity)
  * A **title** describing what the chart shows.

---

### ⚠️ Common mistakes

* Not checking the **scale** — e.g. thinking each line = 1 when it’s actually 2 or 5.
* Comparing **bar lengths by sight** instead of using the scale.
* Forgetting to read **axis labels** (what the numbers really mean).

### 🧮 Examples:

#### Example 1 – Reading a bar chart

| Favourite Fruit  | Apples | Bananas | Grapes | Oranges |
| :--------------- | -----: | ------: | -----: | ------: |
| Number of pupils |     10 |       6 |      4 |       8 |

**Which fruit is most popular?**
→ Apples (10 pupils)

**How many more chose apples than grapes?**
→ 10 − 4 = 6 pupils

---

#### Example 2 – Understanding scale

If the y-axis goes 0, 5, 10, 15 … then
a bar reaching halfway between 10 and 15 = **12 or 13**, depending on spacing — check carefully!
Always count the small divisions.

---

#### Example 3 – Drawing your own bar chart

Survey: Red 6, Blue 3, Green 5, Yellow 4
1 square = 1 vote.
Draw equal-width bars rising to heights 6, 3, 5, 4.
Add a title – “Favourite Colours”.

---

#### Example 4 – Grouped data

If each bar stands for a *year* (e.g. 2022 → 15, 2023 → 18, 2024 → 21), you can spot **trends** — rising, falling, steady.

---

#### Example 5 – Double bar chart

Two bars per category (e.g. boys vs girls).
Use a **key** to show which is which.
Compare heights to see differences clearly.
