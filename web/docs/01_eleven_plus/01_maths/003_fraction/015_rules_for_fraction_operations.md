# Rules for Fraction Operations

### 1. ADDITION (+)
**When to use:** Combining or putting together

**Key words:** "altogether," "total," "in all," "combined," "both"

**Example:** Tom ate $\tfrac{1}{4}$ of pizza, Lucy ate $\tfrac{1}{3}$ of pizza = How much pizza eaten **altogether**?
→ **ADD:** $\tfrac{1}{4}$ + $\tfrac{1}{3}$

### 2. SUBTRACTION (-)
**When to use:** Taking away or finding the difference

**Key words:** "left over," "remaining," "more than," "difference," "how much more"

**Example:** Sarah had $\tfrac{3}{4}$ cup flour, used $\tfrac{1}{3}$ cup. How much is **left over**?
→ **SUBTRACT:** $\tfrac{3}{4}$ - $\tfrac{1}{3}$

### 3. MULTIPLICATION (×)
**When to use:** Finding a PART of something

**Key words:** "of," "What fraction of," "Find $\tfrac{2}{3}$ of"

**Example:** Emma ate $\tfrac{1}{2}$ **of** a cake that was $\tfrac{3}{4}$ the normal size.
→ **MULTIPLY:** $\tfrac{1}{2}$ × $\tfrac{3}{4}$

### 4. DIVISION (÷)
**When to use:** Splitting into equal parts or finding HOW MANY

**Key words:** "How many," "divided into," "each piece," "per person"

**Example:** **How many** $\tfrac{1}{8}$ cup servings can you make from $\tfrac{3}{4}$ cup?
→ **DIVIDE:** $\tfrac{3}{4}$ ÷ $\tfrac{1}{8}$

## Super Simple Memory Trick

**"APTM"** - **A**dd **P**ut **T**ake **M**any

- **A**dd = putting together
- **P**art = multiplication (finding part "of")
- **T**ake away = subtraction  
- **M**any = division (how many)

---

## Quick Decision Tree

When you see a fraction word problem, ask:

1. **Am I putting things together?** → **ADD**
2. **Am I taking something away?** → **SUBTRACT**  
3. **Am I finding a part OF something?** → **MULTIPLY**
4. **Am I finding HOW MANY of something?** → **DIVIDE**

---

## Practice This Simple Method:

**Step 1:** Read the problem
**Step 2:** Find the key word (altogether, left over, of, how many)
**Step 3:** Match it to the operation
**Step 4:** Solve

**Example:** "Tom has $\tfrac{2}{3}$ cup of juice. He drinks $\tfrac{1}{4}$ cup. How much is left over?"

- Key word: "**left over**" 
- Operation: **SUBTRACT**
- Answer: $\tfrac{2}{3}$ - $\tfrac{1}{4}$

Try this method and it will become automatic very quickly!

## ANSWERS WITH EXPLANATIONS

### Section A: Fraction Comparison (1-10)

**1. Answer: Tom ate more pizza**
- Sarah: $\tfrac{3}{8}$, Tom: $\tfrac{2}{5}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{3}{8}$ = $\tfrac{15}{40}$, $\tfrac{2}{5}$ = $\tfrac{16}{40}$
- Since $\tfrac{16}{40}$ > $\tfrac{15}{40}$, Tom ate more

**2. Answer: No, she does not have enough flour**
- Recipe needs: $\tfrac{2}{3}$ cup, Mary has: $\tfrac{5}{8}$ cup
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{2}{3}$ = $\tfrac{16}{24}$, $\tfrac{5}{8}$ = $\tfrac{15}{24}$
- Since $\tfrac{15}{24}$ < $\tfrac{16}{24}$, she doesn't have enough

**3. Answer: James ran further**
- James: $\tfrac{3}{4}$ mile, Lucy: $\tfrac{7}{10}$ mile
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{3}{4}$ = $\tfrac{15}{20}$, $\tfrac{7}{10}$ = $\tfrac{14}{20}$
- Since $\tfrac{15}{20}$ > $\tfrac{14}{20}$, James ran further

**4. Answer: The first bottle ($\tfrac{5}{6}$ litre) contains more water**
- Bottle 1: $\tfrac{5}{6}$, Bottle 2: $\tfrac{4}{5}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{5}{6}$ = $\tfrac{25}{30}$, $\tfrac{4}{5}$ = $\tfrac{24}{30}$
- Since $\tfrac{25}{30}$ > $\tfrac{24}{30}$, the first bottle contains more

**5. Answer: Alex completed a greater fraction**
- Emma: $\tfrac{7}{12}$, Alex: $\tfrac{3}{5}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{7}{12}$ = $\tfrac{35}{60}$, $\tfrac{3}{5}$ = $\tfrac{36}{60}$
- Since $\tfrac{36}{60}$ > $\tfrac{35}{60}$, Alex completed more

**6. Answer: The first car ($\tfrac{3}{8}$ full) has more fuel**
- Car 1: $\tfrac{3}{8}$, Car 2: $\tfrac{2}{7}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{3}{8}$ = $\tfrac{21}{56}$, $\tfrac{2}{7}$ = $\tfrac{16}{56}$
- Since $\tfrac{21}{56}$ > $\tfrac{16}{56}$, the first car has more fuel

**7. Answer: Lisa's brother ate more chocolate**
- Lisa: $\tfrac{5}{9}$, Brother: $\tfrac{4}{7}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{5}{9}$ = $\tfrac{35}{63}$, $\tfrac{4}{7}$ = $\tfrac{36}{63}$
- Since $\tfrac{36}{63}$ > $\tfrac{35}{63}$, her brother ate more

**8. Answer: Pipe A has lost more water**
- Pipe A: $\tfrac{3}{10}$, Pipe B: $\tfrac{2}{9}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{3}{10}$ = $\tfrac{27}{90}$, $\tfrac{2}{9}$ = $\tfrac{20}{90}$
- Since $\tfrac{27}{90}$ > $\tfrac{20}{90}$, Pipe A lost more

**9. Answer: Flowers take up more space**
- Vegetables: $\tfrac{7}{15}$, Flowers: $\tfrac{2}{5}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{7}{15}$ = $\tfrac{7}{15}$, $\tfrac{2}{5}$ = $\tfrac{6}{15}$
- Since $\tfrac{7}{15}$ > $\tfrac{6}{15}$, vegetables actually take up more space

[Correction: Vegetables take up more space]

**10. Answer: Kate saved a greater fraction**
- David: $\tfrac{4}{9}$, Kate: $\tfrac{3}{7}$
- Convert to common denominator: $\tfrac{4}{9}$ = $\tfrac{28}{63}$, $\tfrac{3}{7}$ = $\tfrac{27}{63}$
- Since $\tfrac{28}{63}$ > $\tfrac{27}{63}$, David actually saved more

[Correction: David saved a greater fraction]
