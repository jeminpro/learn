# Understanding Fractions

A **fraction** is a way of showing a part of something. Think of a fraction as a pizza that’s been sliced up.

* The **top number** (called the **numerator**) tells us **how many parts we have**.
* The **bottom number** (called the **denominator**) tells us **how many equal parts the whole is split into**.

Example:
In $\tfrac{3}{4}$ the **3** means we have 3 parts, and the **4** means the whole is split into 4 parts. So $\tfrac{3}{4}$ is **3 out of 4 equal parts**.

### 🎨 Visual Metaphor:

Imagine a chocolate bar split into 8 pieces. If you eat 5, you’ve eaten $\tfrac{5}{8}$ of it!

### 🧠 Key Ideas:

* Fractions are about **equal parts**.
* Every whole number can be written as a fraction. (Example: $1 = \tfrac{2}{2}$ or $\tfrac{3}{3}$)
* Fractions can be **proper** (less than 1) like $\tfrac{3}{4}$ or **improper** (more than 1) like $\tfrac{7}{4}$.
* An **improper fraction** can also be written as a **mixed number**. (Example: $\tfrac{7}{4} = 1\tfrac{3}{4}$)

### 🧮 Examples:

1. 🍕 A pizza is cut into 6 slices. You eat 2. What fraction did you eat? → $\tfrac{2}{6}$
2. 🧃 A juice bottle is filled up to $\tfrac{3}{5}$. What part is empty? → $\tfrac{2}{5}$
3. 🧩 Write 1 whole as a fraction with 4 as the denominator. → $\tfrac{4}{4}$
4. 🍫 You eat $1\tfrac{1}{2}$ chocolate bars. Write this as a fraction. → $\tfrac{3}{2}$
5. 🥧 Shade $\tfrac{3}{4}$ of a rectangle split into 4 equal parts → Shade 3 parts

💡 **Common Mistakes to Avoid:**

* Don’t confuse numerator and denominator.
* Fractions must be of **equal parts** — 2 out of 5 *unequal* slices isn't $\tfrac{2}{5}$!
