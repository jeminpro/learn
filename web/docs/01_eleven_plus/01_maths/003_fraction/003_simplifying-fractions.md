# Simplifying Fractions

**Simplifying a fraction** means rewriting it using the **smallest numbers possible** while keeping the value the same. It’s like shrinking a fraction to its **most reduced form**.

### 🍕 Real-Life Analogy:

Imagine cutting a pizza into 8 equal slices and eating 4. You can say:

* "I ate 4 out of 8 slices" → $\tfrac{4}{8}$
* But we know $\tfrac{4}{8}$ is the same as **$\tfrac{1}{2}$**.

So, **$\tfrac{1}{2}$ is the simplified version** of $\tfrac{4}{8}$.

### 🧠 How to Simplify:

1. **Find the greatest number** that divides both the numerator and denominator (called the **GCD** or **HCF**).
2. Divide both top and bottom by that number.

> Example:
> Simplify $\tfrac{6}{9}$
> GCD of 6 and 9 = 3
> → $6 \div 3 = 2$, $9 \div 3 = 3$
> So, $\tfrac{6}{9} = \tfrac{2}{3}$

### 🧊 Tip:

If you divide the numerator and denominator by the same number, you are keeping the **value** the same — just writing it more simply.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Simplify $\tfrac{12}{16}$
   → GCD = 4 → $12 \div 4 = 3$, $16 \div 4 = 4$ → Answer: **$\tfrac{3}{4}$**

2. Simplify $\tfrac{10}{25}$
   → GCD = 5 → $\tfrac{2}{5}$

3. Simplify $\tfrac{14}{21}$
   → GCD = 7 → $\tfrac{2}{3}$

4. Simplify $\tfrac{9}{12}$
   → GCD = 3 → $\tfrac{3}{4}$

5. Simplify $\tfrac{100}{120}$
   → GCD = 20 → $\tfrac{5}{6}$
