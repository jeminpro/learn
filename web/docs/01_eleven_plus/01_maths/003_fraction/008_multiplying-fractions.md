# Multiplying Fractions

To **multiply fractions**, you don’t need common denominators! 🎉
Instead, it’s one of the most straightforward fraction operations:

> **Multiply the numerators**,
> **Multiply the denominators**,
> Then **simplify** if possible.

### 🍕 Real-Life Analogy:

You eat **1/2 of a pizza**, but you only want to eat **1/3** of that half.

That’s:
**1/3 × 1/2** = "One third of one half" = **1/6** of the whole pizza.

### 🧠 Steps to Multiply Fractions:

#### ✅ Fraction × Fraction

Multiply top × top, bottom × bottom.

> Example:
> 2/3 × 4/5 = (2×4)/(3×5) = **8/15**

#### ✅ Fraction × Whole Number

Turn the whole number into a fraction by writing it over 1.

> Example:
> 3 × 2/5 = 3/1 × 2/5 = 6/5 = **1 1/5**

### 🧊 Simplify First!

Before multiplying, you can **cancel any common factors diagonally** to make life easier.

> 2/3 × 9/10 → cancel 3 & 9 → 2/1 × 3/10 = **6/10 = 3/5**

### 🧮 Examples:

1. 1/2 × 1/4 = 1/8
2. 3/5 × 2/3 = 6/15 = **2/5**
3. 4/7 × 1/2 = 4/14 = **2/7**
4. 3 × 2/5 = 6/5 = **1 1/5**
5. 5/6 × 3/4 = 15/24 = **5/8**
