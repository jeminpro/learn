# Adding Fractions

To **add fractions**, they must have the **same denominator**. The denominator tells us the size of the slices, and we can only add slices of the **same size**!

> Think of pizzas:
> You can add 1/4 + 2/4 because both are in **quarters**.
> But you canâ€™t directly add 1/3 + 1/4 â€” the slices are **different sizes**.

### ðŸ§  Steps to Add Fractions:

#### Case 1: **Same Denominator**

Just add the numerators (top numbers).
Keep the denominator the same.

> Example:
> 2/7 + 3/7 = (2 + 3)/7 = **5/7**

#### Case 2: **Different Denominators**

1. **Find a common denominator** (use LCM if needed).
2. **Convert both fractions** to have that denominator.
3. **Add the numerators**, keep the denominator.

> Example:
> 1/2 + 1/3 â†’ LCM of 2 and 3 = 6
> â†’ 1/2 = 3/6, 1/3 = 2/6 â†’ 3/6 + 2/6 = **5/6**

### ðŸ’¡ Tips:

* Always **simplify** the final answer if possible.
* Watch out for improper fractions â€” convert to **mixed numbers** if asked.

### ðŸ§® Examples:

1. 1/4 + 2/4 = 3/4

2. 3/10 + 4/10 = 7/10

3. 1/3 + 1/6 â†’ Common denominator = 6
   â†’ 2/6 + 1/6 = **3/6 = 1/2**

4. 2/5 + 1/3 â†’ LCM = 15
   â†’ 6/15 + 5/15 = **11/15**

5. 3/8 + 5/8 = **8/8 = 1**
