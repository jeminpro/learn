# Subtracting Fractions

**Subtracting fractions** is very similar to adding them. But instead of combining, we’re finding the **difference between two parts**.

Just like with addition, you need to have the **same denominator** to subtract properly.

### 🧠 Steps to Subtract Fractions:

#### ✅ Case 1: Same Denominator

Subtract the numerators. Keep the denominator the same.

> Example:
> $\tfrac{5}{8}$ − $\tfrac{2}{8}$ = (5 − 2)/8 = **$\tfrac{3}{8}$**

#### ✅ Case 2: Different Denominators

1. **Find a common denominator**
2. **Convert both fractions** to have that denominator
3. **Subtract the numerators**
4. Simplify if needed

> Example:
> $\tfrac{3}{4}$ − $\tfrac{1}{3}$ → LCM of 4 and 3 = 12
> → $\tfrac{9}{12}$ − $\tfrac{4}{12}$ = $\tfrac{5}{12}$

### 🧠 Special Cases:

* If the result is **0**, that means the parts were equal (e.g. $\tfrac{2}{5}$ − $\tfrac{2}{5}$ = 0)
* If the first fraction is **smaller**, the result is a **negative number**, but we avoid those in primary-level problems
* Answers can be **proper**, **improper**, or **mixed numbers**

### 🧮 Examples:

1. $\tfrac{6}{9}$ − $\tfrac{2}{9}$ = $\tfrac{4}{9}$
2. $\tfrac{4}{5}$ − $\tfrac{3}{5}$ = $\tfrac{1}{5}$
3. $\tfrac{7}{8}$ − $\tfrac{3}{8}$ = $\tfrac{4}{8}$ = **$\tfrac{1}{2}$**
4. $\tfrac{5}{6}$ − $\tfrac{1}{2}$ → $\tfrac{10}{12}$ − $\tfrac{6}{12}$ = **$\tfrac{4}{12}$ = $\tfrac{1}{3}$**
5. $\tfrac{3}{4}$ − $\tfrac{2}{3}$ → $\tfrac{9}{12}$ − $\tfrac{8}{12}$ = **$\tfrac{1}{12}$**
