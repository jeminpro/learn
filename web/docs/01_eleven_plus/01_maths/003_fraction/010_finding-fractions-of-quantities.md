# Finding Fractions of Quantities

### 📘 Explanation:

When a question asks **“Find $\tfrac{2}{5}$ of 30,”** it means:

> Split 30 into 5 equal parts, then take 2 of them.

This is just **multiplying the fraction by the number**.

> So:
> $\tfrac{2}{5}$ of 30 = **$\tfrac{2}{5}$ × 30 = (2 × 30) ÷ 5 = 60 ÷ 5 = 12**

### 🧠 Key Steps:

1. **Multiply** the numerator by the quantity
2. **Divide** by the denominator
3. **Simplify** if needed

### 🍰 Real-Life Analogy:

You have 24 cupcakes.
If your friend eats **$\tfrac{1}{4}$** of them, how many did they eat?

→ Divide 24 by 4 = 6
→ Your friend ate **6 cupcakes**

### 🧮 Examples:

1. $\tfrac{1}{3}$ of 12 = 12 ÷ 3 = **4**
2. $\tfrac{2}{5}$ of 25 = (2 × 25) ÷ 5 = **10**
3. $\tfrac{3}{4}$ of 20 = 60 ÷ 4 = **15**
4. $\tfrac{5}{6}$ of 18 = (5 × 18) ÷ 6 = 90 ÷ 6 = **15**
5. $\tfrac{2}{3}$ of 150 = **100**
