# Solving Word Problems Involving Fractions

This topic brings **everything together** — addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and interpreting what a fraction means in real life.

It’s not just about numbers; it’s about:

* Understanding what’s being asked
* Choosing the right operation
* Showing your working clearly
* Applying **fraction logic** to **real-life contexts**

### 🧠 Strategy:

1. **Read carefully**: What’s the total? What part?
2. **Underline keywords**: “of”, “left”, “shared”, “each gets”, “more than”, etc.
3. **Choose the right operation**:

   * "Of" → Multiply
   * "Shared between" → Divide
   * "Left over" → Subtract
   * "Together" → Add
4. **Simplify** at the end

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Sam eats $\tfrac{2}{5}$ of a 30cm chocolate bar. How much did he eat?
   → $\tfrac{2}{5}$ × 30 = **12cm**

2. A jug holds 1 litre. You drink $\tfrac{3}{4}$ of it and your friend drinks $\tfrac{1}{4}$. How much is left?
   → 1 − ($\tfrac{3}{4}$ + $\tfrac{1}{4}$) = **0L** (none left)

3. A cake is $\tfrac{2}{3}$ kg. You divide it equally between 4 people.
   → $\tfrac{2}{3}$ ÷ 4 = $\tfrac{2}{3}$ × $\tfrac{1}{4}$ = **$\tfrac{2}{12}$ = $\tfrac{1}{6}$ kg each**

3. $\tfrac{1}{2}$ litre

4. $\tfrac{1}{4}$ each

5. 10 girls

6. 3 pens

7. 10

8. 20 pages

9. 15 students

10. 6m

11. Ate: 1kg, Left: 0.2kg

12. 120 km

13. 50 ÷ $\tfrac{2}{3}$ = 75L

14. $\tfrac{2}{3}$ ÷ $\tfrac{1}{6}$ = 4 cups

15. $\tfrac{1}{4}$ of 36 = 9 → Others = 9

16. Used = 200g, Left = 120g

17. $\tfrac{2}{5}$ + $\tfrac{1}{5}$ = $\tfrac{3}{5}$ → Left = $\tfrac{2}{5}$

18. $\tfrac{3}{4}$ × $\tfrac{2}{3}$ = $\tfrac{6}{12}$ = 1/2m

19. 150 left

20. 36 apples total → 6 each

21. 500 × $\tfrac{3}{4}$ = 375 → $\tfrac{2}{3}$ × 375 = 250ml

22. $\tfrac{4}{5}$ × $\tfrac{3}{5}$ = $\tfrac{12}{25}$ → Left = $\tfrac{13}{25}$ of 5kg = 2.6kg

23. $\tfrac{5}{8}$ of 120 = 75, $\tfrac{3}{20}$ = 18 → Travelled = 93 → Left = 27km

24. $\tfrac{4}{7}$ + $\tfrac{3}{7}$ = 1 → None remains

25. $\tfrac{3}{5}$ − $\tfrac{1}{5}$ = $\tfrac{2}{5}$

26. 12 ÷ $\tfrac{2}{3}$ = 12 × $\tfrac{3}{2}$ = 18 pieces

27. $\tfrac{3}{4}$ ÷ $\tfrac{1}{8}$ = 6 cups

28. $\tfrac{2}{3}$ in 4 days → $\tfrac{1}{3}$ = 2 days → Total = 6 days
