# Equivalent Fractions

**Equivalent fractions** are different fractions that show the same amount.

Imagine a pizza:

* If you eat **$\tfrac{1}{2}$** of a pizza, it's the same as eating **$\tfrac{2}{4}$** or **$\tfrac{4}{8}$** — you're just slicing the pizza differently!

### 🔍 Visual Metaphor:

Picture a chocolate bar:

* Break it into 2 pieces and eat 1 → $\tfrac{1}{2}$
* Now break the same bar into 4 pieces and eat 2 → $\tfrac{2}{4}$
* It looks different, but it's the **same amount** eaten!

### 🔢 How to Find Equivalent Fractions:

You can multiply (or divide) the **numerator and denominator by the same number**.

> Example:

> $\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{1 \times 2}{2 \times 2} = \tfrac{2}{4}$

> $\tfrac{1}{2} = \tfrac{1 \times 5}{2 \times 5} = \tfrac{5}{10}$

### 🚫 Common Mistakes:

* You can’t just multiply or divide **one part** of the fraction (just the top or bottom).
  That changes the value!

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Are $\tfrac{3}{6}$ and $\tfrac{1}{2}$ equivalent?
   → Yes, $3 \div 3 = 1$ and $6 \div 3 = 2$ → $\tfrac{3}{6} = \tfrac{1}{2}$

2. Write two equivalent fractions to $\tfrac{2}{3}$:
   → $\tfrac{4}{6}$ and $\tfrac{6}{9}$ (Multiply top and bottom by 2 and 3)

3. Is $\tfrac{5}{10}$ the same as $\tfrac{1}{2}$?
   → Yes, divide both top and bottom by 5.

4. Find an equivalent of $\tfrac{3}{4}$ with denominator 12:
   → Multiply both by 3 → $\tfrac{9}{12}$

5. Circle the pairs that are equivalent:
   a) $\tfrac{1}{3}$ and $\tfrac{2}{6}$ ✔️
   b) $\tfrac{3}{4}$ and $\tfrac{6}{9}$ ✖️
   c) $\tfrac{2}{5}$ and $\tfrac{6}{15}$ ✔️
