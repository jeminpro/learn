# Forming Expressions

### 📘 Explanation:

**Forming expressions** means writing a **mathematical rule or statement** using **letters (variables)** and **numbers** instead of full sentences.

It’s like turning words into maths.

#### 🧩 What is an expression?

An **expression** shows a **calculation** but **doesn’t have an equals sign**.

Example:

* “3 more than a number” → `x + 3`
* “Twice a number” → `2x`

An **equation**, in contrast, always has an equals sign (=).
Example: `2x + 3 = 9`.

### 💡 Why it matters

In many 11+ questions, you’ll be asked to turn a *word problem* into an expression before solving it.
It’s a bit like translating English into “maths language”.

### 🧱 Step-by-step approach

1. **Choose a letter** to represent the unknown (usually x, n, or t).
   e.g. “a number” → x.

2. **Translate the words** into symbols:

   * *more than / increased by / plus* → `+`
   * *less than / decreased by / minus* → `−`
   * *times / double / triple* → `×`
   * *divided by / shared between* → `÷` or `/`

3. **Write neatly**:

   * `3 × x` becomes `3x`
   * `x × x` becomes `x²`

### ⚠️ Common traps

| Mistake                                                      | Correct form          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------- |
| Writing 3 + x when it says “3 times a number”                | It should be 3x       |
| Forgetting order: “3 less than x” means x − 3, **not** 3 − x |                       |
| Mixing up “total of” with “difference of”                    | Always read carefully |

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Example 1: “3 more than a number”**

   * Let the number = x
   * Expression = x + 3

2. **Example 2: “Twice a number minus 5”**

   * “Twice a number” = 2x
   * “Minus 5” → 2x − 5

3. **Example 3: “Half of a number plus 6”**

   * “Half of a number” = x/2
   * “Plus 6” → x/2 + 6

4. **Example 4: “A number multiplied by 7, then decreased by 4”**

   * Expression: 7x − 4

5. **Example 5 (in context): “A rectangle has length l and width w. Write an expression for its perimeter.”**

   * Perimeter = 2l + 2w

### 🧠 Quick Recap Tips:

* **“More than” → +**, **“less than” → −** (but watch the order!)
* Multiplication hides between numbers and letters (e.g., 3x, not 3 × x)
* Check context: if it’s **money**, use £; if it’s **length**, use cm/m.
* Say it out loud in words to test:
  If `3x − 2` means “3 times a number minus 2,” you’ve got it right!
