# Solving Equations

### 📘 Explanation:

An **equation** is like a **balance** — both sides must be **equal**.

Think of the equal sign (=) as a **seesaw**:
If you add or remove something on one side, you must do the **same** to the other side to keep it balanced.

The goal in solving an equation is to **find the value of the letter** (the variable) that makes the two sides equal.

#### 🧩 Example idea:

If you had a mystery box and 3 marbles weigh the same as 9 marbles, then the box must weigh 6 marbles — that’s algebra in disguise!

### 🔑 Key steps to solve equations:

1. **Understand what’s happening**
   What’s being done to the variable (×, ÷, +, −)?

2. **Do the opposite (inverse operation)**

   * If something is **added**, **subtract** it.
   * If something is **multiplied**, **divide** it.

3. **Keep the balance**
   Whatever you do on one side, do on the other side too.

4. **Work step by step**
   Always simplify and isolate the variable.

### ⚠️ Common mistakes:

* Forgetting to do the operation to **both sides**.
* Mixing up the signs (+ and −).
* Doing the steps in the wrong order.
* Forgetting to simplify before solving.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Example 1 – One-step (addition)**

   * Solve: x + 5 = 9
   * Take away 5 from both sides → x = 9 − 5
     ✅ **x = 4**

2. **Example 2 – One-step (multiplication)**

   * Solve: 3x = 18
   * Divide both sides by 3 → x = 18 ÷ 3
     ✅ **x = 6**

3. **Example 3 – Two-step**

   * Solve: 2x + 3 = 9
   * Subtract 3 → 2x = 6
   * Divide by 2 → x = 3
     ✅ **x = 3**

4. **Example 4 – Using fractions**

   * Solve: x/4 = 5
   * Multiply both sides by 4 → x = 20
     ✅ **x = 20**

5. **Example 5 – Negative numbers**

   * Solve: x − 7 = −3
   * Add 7 to both sides → x = 4
     ✅ **x = 4**

### 🧠 Tips for Success:

* **Check your answer**: Substitute back into the equation to verify.
  Example: If x = 4 in 2x + 3 = 11 → 2(4) + 3 = 11 ✓
* **Work neatly**: Each step on a new line helps avoid confusion.
* **Remember**: What you do to one side, **must** be done to the other side.
