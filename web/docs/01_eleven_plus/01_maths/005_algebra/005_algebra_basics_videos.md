## [1. Algebra Basics: What Is Algebra?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NybHckSEQBI)


### 📘 Overview

This introductory video explains what **algebra** is and why it is useful. Algebra uses **letters (variables)** to stand for unknown numbers. Using variables allows us to express general patterns, solve problems, and work with values we don’t yet know.

Key ideas:

* A **variable** is a letter like *x* or *n* used to represent a number.
* An **expression** is a combination of numbers, letters, and operations.
* *3x* means **3 × x**, even though the multiplication sign is not written.
* Algebra lets us solve real-world problems by setting up relationships between known and unknown values.

This foundation prepares you for solving equations later.

### ✏️ Practice Questions

1. What is a variable?
2. Why do we use letters in algebra?
3. In the expression *4a + 7*, what is the variable?
4. Evaluate *2x + 5* when *x = 3*.
5. Write an algebraic expression for: “Seven more than a number *n*.”
6. If $x + 6 = 10$, what number is x?
7. Explain in your own words what algebra allows us to do.

## [2. Algebra Basics: Solving Basic Equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3XzepN03KQ)

### 📘 Overview

This video teaches **one-step equations**, where you undo one operation to isolate the variable. The equals sign works like a **balance**—whatever you do to one side, you must do to the other.

Key ideas:

* Use the **inverse operation** to undo what was done to x

  * If the equation adds → you subtract
  * If it subtracts → you add
  * If it multiplies → you divide
  * If it divides → you multiply
* Your goal is to isolate *x*.
* Always **check** your answer by substituting back into the equation.

### ✏️ Practice Questions

1. $x + 7 = 12$
2. $x - 9 = 4$
3. $4x = 20$
4. $\frac{x}{3} = 9$
5. $x - 3 = 18$
6. "Three times a number is 24." Write and solve the equation.
7. Check your answer for $x = 5$ in the equation $3x = 15$.

## [3. Algebra Basics: Solving 2-Step Equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qyd_v3DGzTM)

### 📘 Overview

This lesson covers **two-step equations**, where two operations have been performed on the variable. To solve, you must undo them in the **opposite order**.

Example:
$$
3x + 4 = 19
$$

Steps:

1. Undo addition/subtraction → subtract 4
2. Undo multiplication/division → divide by 3

This gives $x = 5$.

Key ideas:

* Remove constants first.
* Remove coefficients second.
* Follow the correct order of inverse operations.
* Always check your solution.

### ✏️ Practice Questions

1. $3x + 5 = 20$
2. $4x - 7 = 21$
3. $\frac{x}{2} + 6 = 11$
4. $\frac{x}{3} - 4 = 2$
5. $5x + 9 = 34$
6. Write and solve: "A number divided by 4, minus 2, gives 3."
7. Solve: $7x + 2 = 44$

## [4. Algebra Basics: Solving Multi-Step Equations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LDIiYKYvvdA)

### 📘 Overview

This video explains how to solve **multi-step equations**, which may include:

* Parentheses
* Like terms
* Variables on both sides
* Multiple operations

Typical steps:

1. **Remove parentheses** using the distributive property
2. **Combine like terms**
3. **Move variables to one side**
4. **Isolate x** using inverse operations

Example:
$$
3(x + 4) - 2 = 22
$$

Simplify → isolate → solve → check.

### ✏️ Practice Questions

1. $2(x + 5) = 26$
2. $3(x - 2) + 4 = 19$
3. $3x + 7 + x = 27$
4. $6x - 4 - 2x = 20$
5. $4x + 3 = 2x + 17$
6. $7x - 5 = 3x + 15$
7. $3(x + 4) - 2 = 22$

## [5. Algebra Basics: The Distributive Property](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S3IEeCyUWWA)

### 📘 Overview

This lesson introduces the **distributive property**, which lets you multiply a number across terms inside parentheses:

$$
a(b + c) = ab + ac
$$

Used when:

* You **cannot** simplify inside the parentheses
* You need to **expand** expressions
* You want to remove parentheses when solving equations

The video also shows how to **factor** (reverse distribution):

$$
12x + 6 = 6(2x + 1)
$$

It emphasises careful handling of negative signs.

### ✏️ Practice Questions

1. Expand: $3(x + 4)$
2. Expand: $5(x - 2)$
3. Expand: $-2(x + 3)$
4. Expand: $7(-x + 2)$
5. Factor: $12x + 4$
6. Factor: $15x - 10$
7. Solve: $3(x + 4) = 27$

## [6. Algebra Basics: Combining Like Terms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LkhPRz7Hocg)

### 📘 Overview

This video explains how to **simplify expressions** by combining **like terms**, which are terms with:

* The **same variable**
* Raised to the **same power**

Examples of like terms:

* $3x$ and $7x$
* $-2y^2$ and $5y^2$

Examples of *not* like terms:

* $x$ and $y$
* $x$ and $x^2$

To combine like terms, add or subtract the **coefficients**.

Examples:
$$
3x + 7x = 10x
$$
[

* x + 6x = 5x
  ]

This is essential before solving multi-step equations.

### ✏️ Practice Questions

1. $3x + 5x$
2. $7y - 2y$
3. $-x + 6x$
4. $4x - 2x + x$
5. $3x + 4y + 2x$
6. $5a - 2b + 7a + b$
7. Combine after distributing: $2(x + 5) + 3x$
