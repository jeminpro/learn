# Written Division

### 📘 Explanation:

**Division** means **sharing** or **grouping** a total into equal parts.
It’s the opposite of multiplication.

For example:
12 ÷ 3 = 4 means “if 12 apples are shared among 3 friends, each gets 4 apples.”

When numbers get bigger, we use **written methods** — **short division (bus stop)** and **long division**.

Think of it like **fairly sharing sweets** — you start from the biggest pile (hundreds), share what you can, and carry the leftovers (remainder) to the next group.

### 💡 Key Steps (Short Division – “Bus Stop” Method)

Let’s divide **468 ÷ 4**.

```
    ______
4 | 468
```

1. Divide **4 into 4** → 1 (no remainder)
2. Divide **4 into 6** → 1 (remainder 2)
3. Bring down the 8 → now 28 ÷ 4 = 7
   ✅ Answer: **117**

### 💡 Key Steps (Long Division – for 2-digit divisors)

Let’s divide **672 ÷ 16**.

1. 16 × 4 = 64 → write 4 above 67
2. Subtract 64 → remainder 3
3. Bring down the 2 → 32 ÷ 16 = 2
   ✅ Answer: **42**

### 🧮 Examples:

#### 1. Simple Short Division

```
  96 ÷ 3
```

* 3 into 9 = 3
* 3 into 6 = 2
  ✅ Answer: **32**

---

#### 2. With Remainder

```
  95 ÷ 4
```

* 4 into 9 = 2 (remainder 1)
* Bring down 5 → 15 ÷ 4 = 3 remainder 3
  ✅ Answer: **23 remainder 3**

---

#### 3. 3-Digit ÷ 1-Digit

```
  672 ÷ 6
```

* 6 into 6 = 1
* 6 into 7 = 1 (remainder 1)
* 6 into 12 = 2
  ✅ Answer: **112**

---

#### 4. Long Division

```
  936 ÷ 12
```

12 × 7 = 84 → remainder 9
Bring down 6 → 96 ÷ 12 = 8
✅ Answer: **78**

#### 5. Real-Life Example

A shop packs **648 apples** into boxes of **12 apples each**.
How many boxes are needed?
648 ÷ 12 = **54 boxes**

---

#### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Forgetting to **carry remainders** to the next column.
* Writing digits in the wrong place above the bus stop.
* Not checking answers with **multiplication** (use inverse check).
* Forgetting to bring down the next digit when needed.
