# Factors

### 📘 Explanation:

A **factor** is a number that **divides exactly** into another number — with **no remainder**.
In other words, it “fits neatly” into the number.

> Example:
> 6 ÷ 3 = 2 → ✅ So 3 is a **factor** of 6.

You can think of factors as **building blocks** — when you multiply two factors together, you make the original number.

> Example:
> 2 × 6 = 12 → so 2 and 6 are **factors of 12**.

### 💡 Key Ideas

#### 🔹 1. **Definition**

A factor divides a number **without leaving a remainder**.
Example:
4 divides into 12 exactly → 12 ÷ 4 = 3 → ✅ 4 is a factor of 12.

---

#### 🔹 2. **Factor Pairs**

Two factors multiplied together make the number.
Example:
Factors of 12 →
1 × 12
2 × 6
3 × 4
So, factors are **1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12.**

---

#### 🔹 3. **All Numbers Have 1 and Themselves as Factors**

Example:
Factors of 8 → 1, 2, 4, 8.

---

#### 🔹 4. **Even vs Odd Numbers**

* Even numbers always have 2 as a factor.
* Odd numbers do not.

---

#### 🔹 5. **Prime Numbers**

A number with **only two factors** — 1 and itself.
Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19 …

---

#### 🔹 6. **Common Factors**

Numbers that divide into two or more given numbers.
Example:
Factors of 12 → 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12
Factors of 18 → 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18
Common factors → **1, 2, 3, 6**

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Confusing **factors** with **multiples** (factors are smaller; multiples are bigger).
* Forgetting to include 1 and the number itself.
* Missing pairs when listing (always check both directions).
* Counting the same factor twice (e.g. 4 × 4 = 16 → count 4 once).
