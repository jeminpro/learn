# Mental Addition and Subtraction

### 📘 Explanation:

Mental addition and subtraction are all about **thinking quickly and flexibly** with numbers — no pen or paper, just smart strategies in your head.

Imagine you’re shopping and need to work out if you have enough money — mental maths helps you decide **fast**.

### 💡 Key Strategies:

#### 🧠 1. **Partitioning**

Break numbers into parts (hundreds, tens, ones) to make them easier to handle.
Example:
47 + 36 = (40 + 30) + (7 + 6) = 70 + 13 = **83**

---

#### 🧠 2. **Rounding and Adjusting**

Round a number to the nearest 10 or 100, then adjust.
Example:
198 + 47 → 200 + 47 = 247 → subtract 2 = **245**

---

#### 🧠 3. **Compensation (Balancing)**

If you add to one number, subtract from the other to keep the total the same.
Example:
53 + 29 = (53 + 30) − 1 = **82**

---

#### 🧠 4. **Using Number Bonds**

Use known pairs that make 10, 100, 1000, etc.
Example:
600 + 400 = 1000
75 + 25 = 100

---

#### 🧠 5. **Bridging Through 10s or 100s**

Go up to the nearest multiple of 10, then add the rest.
Example:
38 + 7 → 38 + 2 = 40 → +5 = **45**

---

#### 🧠 6. **Difference Thinking (for Subtraction)**

Find how far apart two numbers are instead of “taking away.”
Example:
92 − 47 → from 47 to 50 (+3), 50 to 90 (+40), 90 to 92 (+2) → **45**

---

#### 🧠 7. **Using Inverse Relationships**

Addition and subtraction are opposites.
If 75 + ? = 120, then 120 − 75 = **45**

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Forgetting to adjust after rounding up or down.
* Rushing and missing a carry or small difference.
* Subtracting in the wrong order (doing “big minus small” incorrectly).
* Overcomplicating — choose the simplest strategy!

---

### 🧮 Examples:

#### 1. 48 + 37

Round 37 → 40, so 48 + 40 = 88, then subtract 3 → **85**

#### 2. 125 + 199

Round 199 → 200 → 125 + 200 = 325 → subtract 1 → **324**

#### 3. 83 − 27

27 → 30 (add 3), so 83 − 30 = 53 → +3 = **56**

#### 4. 600 − 275

Think: 275 + ? = 600
Add 25 → 300, then +300 → **325**

#### 5. 49 + 51

Nearly 50 + 50 = 100
✅ Answer: **100**
