# Written Subtraction

### 📘 Explanation:

**Subtraction** means **taking away** or **finding the difference** between numbers.
When numbers are too big for mental maths, we use **written subtraction**, setting numbers in **columns** by place value — just like addition.

Think of it as **borrowing and paying back**. If you don’t have enough in one column, you borrow from the next column on the left (just like borrowing a ten-pound note when you only have coins!).

#### 💡 Key Ideas:

1. **Line up digits carefully** by place value.
2. **Start from the right** (ones) and move left.
3. If the top digit is smaller, **borrow** from the next column.
4. **Subtract each column**, writing the answer underneath.
5. **Check with estimation** — the result should be close to your mental estimate.

### 🧮 Examples:

#### 1. Simple Subtraction (No Borrowing)

```
  543
− 321
------
  222
```

Each digit on top is bigger than the one below — easy subtraction!

#### 2. With Borrowing

```
  652
− 278
------
  374
```

**Step-by-step:**

* Ones: 2 − 8 → can’t do → borrow 1 ten → becomes 12 − 8 = 4
* Tens: now 4 − 7 → borrow 1 hundred → 14 − 7 = 7
* Hundreds: 5 − 2 = 3
  ✅ Answer: **374**

#### 3. With Multiple Borrowings

```
  7002
− 3568
-------
  3434
```

Here, we borrow across zeros:

* Borrow from thousands → 6, 9, 9, 12 pattern
  ✅ Answer: **3434**

#### 4. Real-Life Example

Liam had £125. He spent £68 on trainers.
How much money does he have left?

125 − 68 = **£57**

---

#### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Not lining digits correctly by place value.
* Forgetting to borrow from the next column.
* Borrowing but not reducing the digit on the left.
* Subtracting the smaller number from the larger even when it’s below (reversing the subtraction).
