# Multiples

### 📘 Explanation:

A **multiple** of a number is what you get when you **multiply it by whole numbers** (1, 2, 3, 4, …).

It’s like skip counting — jumping forward in equal steps.

> Example: Multiples of 4 → 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32 …

Each step adds another **4**, just like counting in 4s.

### 💡 Key Ideas:

#### 🔹 1. **Definition**

A multiple of a number can be written as
→ *n × k* (where *n* is the number and *k* is a whole number).

Example: 5 × 7 = 35 → so 35 is a multiple of 5 **and** 7.

---

#### 🔹 2. **Every Number is a Multiple of Itself**

Example:
6 × 1 = 6 → so 6 is a multiple of 6.

---

#### 🔹 3. **Common Multiples**

Multiples shared by two or more numbers.
Example:
Multiples of 3 → 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18
Multiples of 4 → 4, 8, 12, 16, 20
Common multiples → **12, 24, 36, ...**

---

#### 🔹 4. **Lowest Common Multiple (LCM)**

The **smallest** number that is a multiple of two or more numbers.
Example:
LCM of 3 and 4 = **12**

#### 🔹 5. **Useful Divisibility Clues**

| Number | Quick Divisibility Rule              |
| :----: | :----------------------------------- |
|    2   | Last digit even                      |
|    3   | Sum of digits divisible by 3         |
|    4   | Last two digits form a multiple of 4 |
|    5   | Ends in 0 or 5                       |
|    6   | Divisible by both 2 and 3            |
|    9   | Sum of digits divisible by 9         |
|   10   | Ends in 0                            |

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Confusing **multiples** with **factors** (multiples get bigger, factors go into a number).
* Forgetting that 0 is a multiple of **every number**.
* Stopping too early when finding common multiples.
* Assuming two numbers always share a multiple within the first few terms (sometimes need to go further!).
