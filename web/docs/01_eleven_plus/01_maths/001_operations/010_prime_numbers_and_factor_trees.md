# Prime Numbers and Factor Trees

### 📘 Explanation:

A **prime number** is a number that has **exactly two factors** — **1** and **itself**.

That means it can only be divided evenly by 1 and by the number itself.

> Example:
> 7 → factors: 1 and 7 → ✅ prime
> 8 → factors: 1, 2, 4, 8 → ❌ not prime

### 💡 Key Ideas

#### 🔹 1. **Definition**

A **prime number** has **only two factors**, 1 and itself.
A **composite number** has **more than two factors**.

---

#### 🔹 2. **First 20 Prime Numbers**

2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29,
31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71

*(Remember: 2 is the only **even** prime number!)*

---

#### 🔹 3. **Checking for Primes**

To test if a number is prime:

1. Divide it by **2, 3, 5, or 7**.
2. If none divide exactly (without remainder), it’s prime.

Example: 29
→ not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7 → ✅ **prime**

#### 🔹 4. **Prime Factorisation**

Every number can be written as a **product of primes** (called *prime factorisation*).

You can find this using a **factor tree** — breaking a number down step by step until all branches end in primes.

---

#### 🔹 5. **Factor Tree Example (text-based visual)**

Find the prime factors of 60:

```
       60
      /  \
     6    10
    / \   / \
   2  3  2   5
```

Prime factors of 60 → **2 × 2 × 3 × 5 = 2² × 3 × 5**

---

#### 🔹 6. **Using Prime Factors**

You can use prime factors to:

* Find the **HCF** (take common primes)
* Find the **LCM** (take all primes at their highest power)

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Thinking **1 is prime** (❌ it’s not — it has only one factor).
* Forgetting to include *both* 1 and the number itself when listing factors.
* Stopping the factor tree too early (must end at primes).
* Mixing up **prime** and **odd** numbers (not all odd numbers are prime).

### 🧮 Examples

#### 1. Is 29 a prime number?

Yes — only divisible by 1 and 29.

#### 2. Is 35 a prime number?

No — 35 = 5 × 7.

#### 3. Write 18 as a product of prime factors.

18 = 2 × 3 × 3 = **2 × 3²**

#### 4. Write 48 as a product of primes.

48 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 = **2⁴ × 3**

#### 5. Prime factors of 100

100 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 = **2² × 5²**
