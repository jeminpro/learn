# Written Multiplication

### 📘 Explanation:

**Multiplication** means repeated addition.
For example, 4 × 6 means **6 + 6 + 6 + 6 = 24**.

When numbers get large, we use **written methods** like:

* **Grid method** (good for understanding)
* **Column method (long multiplication)** (fastest for larger numbers)

Think of it like **building layers of bricks** — you multiply each layer (digit) carefully, then add everything together to build the full wall (final total).

### 💡 Key Steps (Column Method)

1. **Write numbers in columns**, lining up digits by place value.
2. **Multiply each digit** of the top number by each digit of the bottom number, starting from the right.
3. **Carry over** any tens to the next column.
4. For the next row (tens, hundreds), **add a zero** to shift place value.
5. **Add all rows together** to get the final answer.

### 🧮 Examples:

#### 1. 2-Digit × 1-Digit

```
  34
×  6
-----
 204
```

Steps:

* 6 × 4 = 24 → write 4, carry 2
* 6 × 3 = 18 + 2 = 20
  ✅ Answer: **204**

#### 2. 3-Digit × 1-Digit

```
 237
×  4
-----
 948
```

Steps:

* 4 × 7 = 28 → write 8, carry 2
* 4 × 3 = 12 + 2 = 14 → write 4, carry 1
* 4 × 2 = 8 + 1 = 9
  ✅ Answer: **948**

#### 5. Real-Life Example

A ticket costs **£36**.
If 25 people buy tickets, how much money in total?

36 × 25 = **£900**

#### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Forgetting to **add a zero** for the second row (tens place).
* Not **carrying** correctly.
* Misaligning digits when adding partial products.
* Mixing up place values (especially when multiplying 2-digit × 2-digit).
