# Mental Multiplication and Division

### 📘 Explanation:

Mental multiplication and division help you calculate **quickly in your head** without writing anything down.
They rely on **number facts**, **patterns**, and **smart shortcuts** rather than long calculations.

Think of multiplication as **repeated addition**, and division as **sharing or grouping**.

> Example:
> 8 × 6 means adding 8 six times or 6 eight times → **48**
> 48 ÷ 6 means “how many 6s in 48?” → **8**

### 💡 Key Mental Strategies

#### 🔹 1. **Use Known Facts**

Start from what you know — the easier tables.
If you know 6 × 7 = 42, then 7 × 6 = 42 too!

---

#### 🔹 2. **Doubling and Halving**

* Double one number and halve the other to keep the same product.
  Example: 25 × 12 = (50 × 6) = **300**
* Useful for numbers ending in 5 or even numbers.

---

#### 🔹 3. **Distributive Law (Break Apart)**

Split big numbers into parts.
Example:
23 × 4 = (20 × 4) + (3 × 4) = 80 + 12 = **92**

---

#### 🔹 4. **Using Nearby Numbers**

If 19 × 6 is tricky, think 20 × 6 = 120 and subtract one group of 6 → **114**

---

#### 🔹 5. **Use Place Value Patterns**

Multiply or divide by 10, 100, 1000 by moving digits.

* 36 × 10 = 360
* 360 ÷ 10 = 36

---

#### 🔹 6. **Compensation Strategy**

Round and adjust:

* 49 × 2 = (50 × 2) − 2 = **98**

---

#### 🔹 7. **Link Multiplication and Division**

They are inverse operations:

* If 8 × 9 = 72, then 72 ÷ 8 = 9 and 72 ÷ 9 = 8

---

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Forgetting to adjust after rounding.
* Confusing multiplication and division direction.
* Misplacing zeros when multiplying by 10, 100, etc.
* Forgetting basic table facts (especially 6×, 7×, 8×).

### 🧮 Examples:

#### 1. 25 × 16

→ Double and halve → 50 × 8 = **400**

#### 2. 36 × 5

→ Half of ×10 → (36 × 10) ÷ 2 = 360 ÷ 2 = **180**

#### 3. 48 ÷ 6

→ 6 × 8 = 48 → **8**

#### 4. 19 × 4

→ (20 × 4) − 4 = 80 − 4 = **76**

#### 5. 420 ÷ 10

→ Move digits left → **42**
