# Square and Cube Numbers

### 📘 Explanation:

**Square numbers** and **cube numbers** are special results of multiplying a number by itself — once (for squares) or twice (for cubes).

### 🔷 What is a Square Number?

A **square number** is made by **multiplying a number by itself**.

> Example:
> 4 × 4 = 16 → **16 is a square number.**

We call it **“4 squared”** and write it as **4² = 16**.

Visually, if you arrange dots into a perfect square (same number of rows and columns), that’s a **square number**.

```
4 × 4 square:
⬜⬜⬜⬜  
⬜⬜⬜⬜  
⬜⬜⬜⬜  
⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

### 🔷 What is a Cube Number?

A **cube number** is made by multiplying a number by itself **twice**.

> Example:
> 3 × 3 × 3 = 27 → **27 is a cube number.**

We call it **“3 cubed”** and write it as **3³ = 27**.

Visually, imagine filling a cube with smaller cubes, same number across, along, and up.

```
A 3 × 3 × 3 cube → 27 small cubes total
```

|    3   |      9      |     27    |
|    4   |      16     |     64    |
|    5   |      25     |    125    |
|    6   |      36     |    216    |
|    7   |      49     |    343    |

### 🧮 Examples

#### 1. Find 7²

7 × 7 = **49**

#### 2. Find 9³

9 × 9 × 9 = **729**

#### 3. Which number squared gives 81?

√81 = **9**

#### 4. Which number cubed gives 125?

³√125 = **5**

#### 5. Is 50 a square number?

No — 7² = 49 and 8² = 64, so 50 is between them.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Confusing “×2” (double) with “²” (square).
  *Example: 4 × 2 = 8 ≠ 4² (which is 16)*
* Forgetting that cubes multiply **three times**.
* Mixing up √ (square root) and ³√ (cube root).
* Assuming all even numbers are square numbers (not true!).
