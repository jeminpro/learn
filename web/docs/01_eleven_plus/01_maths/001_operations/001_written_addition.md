# Written Addition

### 📘 Explanation:

**Addition** means combining two or more numbers to find the **total** or **sum**.
When numbers are too large for mental maths, we use **written addition**, lining up digits carefully in **columns**.

Think of it like **stacking building blocks** — each column (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.) must stay in the correct place so the tower doesn’t wobble!

#### 💡 Key Ideas:

1. **Line up digits by place value** (ones under ones, tens under tens, etc.)
2. **Start from the right** (ones column) and move left.
3. If a column adds up to **10 or more**, carry the extra digit to the next column.
4. Add any **carried numbers** before moving to the next column.
5. Finally, **check your answer** — estimate roughly to see if it makes sense.

### 🧮 Examples:

#### 1. Basic Column Addition

```
   243
+  156

   399
```

#### 2. With Carrying

```
   487
+  356
------
   843
```

**Steps:**

* Ones: 7 + 6 = 13 → write 3, carry 1
* Tens: 8 + 5 + 1 (carry) = 14 → write 4, carry 1
* Hundreds: 4 + 3 + 1 (carry) = 8
  ✅ Answer: **843**

#### 3. Adding 3 Numbers

```
  132
+ 248
+ 175
------
  555
```

* Ones: 2 + 8 + 5 = 15 → write 5, carry 1
* Tens: 3 + 4 + 7 + 1 = 15 → write 5, carry 1
* Hundreds: 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 = 5
  ✅ Answer: **555**

#### 4. Real-Life Example

A family travelled **126 miles** on Saturday and **189 miles** on Sunday.
How far did they travel in total?

126 + 189 = **315 miles**

#### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Not lining up digits correctly by place value.
* Forgetting to add the carried number.
* Writing carried numbers in the wrong column.
* Rushing and missing a digit.
