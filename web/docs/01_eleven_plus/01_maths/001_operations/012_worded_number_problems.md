# Worded Number Problems

### 📘 Explanation:

A **word problem** tells a story or situation where maths is hidden inside the words.
To solve it, you need to **understand what’s being asked**, **choose the right operation**, and **work step by step**.

Think of it like being a **maths detective** — you look for **clues** (keywords) to figure out whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide.

### 💡 Key Steps

#### 1. **Read carefully**

Understand what’s happening in the question.

#### 2. **Spot the clue words**

| Operation          | Common clue words                                 |
| :----------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Addition**       | total, altogether, combined, sum, in all          |
| **Subtraction**    | left, remaining, difference, fewer, how many more |
| **Multiplication** | each, groups of, lots of, times, altogether       |
| **Division**       | share, each, equal groups, per, average           |

---

#### 3. **Plan the operation**

Decide whether to add, subtract, multiply, or divide — or a combination.

#### 4. **Estimate first**

Make a quick mental check to see what kind of answer to expect.

#### 5. **Calculate carefully**

Use written or mental methods as needed.

#### 6. **Check the answer**

Does it make sense? Use estimation or reverse operation.

### ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Rushing to calculate before understanding the question.
* Mixing up subtraction and division clue words (“each,” “left”).
* Forgetting to label answers with units (£, cm, litres, etc.).
* Ignoring multi-step problems (solving only the first step).

### 🧮 Examples

#### 1. **Addition Example**

A toy costs £38, and another costs £47. How much altogether?
→ 38 + 47 = **£85**

#### 2. **Subtraction Example**

A bus had 64 passengers. 27 got off. How many remain?
→ 64 − 27 = **37**

#### 3. **Multiplication Example**

There are 24 boxes with 6 pencils in each. How many pencils?
→ 24 × 6 = **144**

#### 4. **Division Example**

120 sweets are shared equally among 8 friends. How many each?
→ 120 ÷ 8 = **15**

#### 5. **Multi-Step Example**

A school raised £365 on Monday and £428 on Tuesday.
They spent £129 on supplies.
How much money do they have left?
→ (365 + 428) − 129 = **£664**
