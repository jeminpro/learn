# Polygons & Circles

### 📘 Explanation:

**Polygons** are flat, closed shapes made up of straight sides. The word *polygon* means “many sides.” Every polygon is named based on how many sides it has.

#### 🔹 Common Polygons:

| Name          | Number of Sides | Example           |
| ------------- | --------------- | ----------------- |
| Triangle      | 3               | Roof truss        |
| Quadrilateral | 4               | Window            |
| Pentagon      | 5               | House roof sign   |
| Hexagon       | 6               | Honeycomb cell    |
| Heptagon      | 7               | Rare in real life |
| Octagon       | 8               | Stop sign         |
| Nonagon       | 9               | Fancy tile design |
| Decagon       | 10              | Coin edge pattern |

#### 🔹 Key Polygon Facts:

* The **sum of interior angles** = (number of sides − 2) × 180°.
  Example: Pentagon → (5 − 2) × 180 = 540°.
* The **exterior angles** always add up to **360°** (one full turn).
* A **regular polygon** has all sides and angles equal.
* In a regular polygon:

  * Each interior angle = [(n − 2) × 180] ÷ n
  * Each exterior angle = 360 ÷ n

### 🟣 Circles

A **circle** is a special curved 2D shape where all points are **the same distance** from a centre.

| Term                  | Meaning                                            | Example               |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| **Radius (r)**        | Distance from centre to edge                       | Half a pizza slice    |
| **Diameter (d)**      | Line across the circle through the centre (d = 2r) | Width of a coin       |
| **Circumference (C)** | Distance around the edge                           | Rim of a wheel        |
| **Chord**             | A line joining two points on the circle            | Guitar string segment |
| **Arc**               | Part of the circumference                          | Edge of a slice       |
| **Sector**            | “Piece of pizza” between two radii                 |                       |
| **Tangent**           | Line that touches the circle at one point only     |                       |

**Important Formulas:**

* Circumference = π × diameter = 2 × π × radius
* Area = π × r²
* For 11+ exams, use π ≈ 3.14 or 22/7.

#### 🧭 Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Confusing diameter and radius (radius is half).
* Forgetting π in circumference or area.
* Thinking polygons can have curved sides (they can’t).
* Mixing interior and exterior angle formulas.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Finding angle sum**

   * Hexagon → (6 − 2) × 180 = **720°**.
   * Common mistake: multiplying 6 × 180 directly.

2. **Each interior angle of a regular octagon**

   * (8 − 2) × 180 ÷ 8 = 6 × 180 ÷ 8 = 1080 ÷ 8 = **135°**.

3. **Finding number of sides**

   * A regular polygon has interior angle 120°.
     (n − 2) × 180 ÷ n = 120 → 180n − 360 = 120n → 60n = 360 → **n = 6** (hexagon).

4. **Circle circumference**

   * Radius = 7 cm → C = 2 × π × 7 ≈ 44 cm.

5. **Circle area**

   * Radius = 5 cm → A = π × 5² = 25π ≈ 78.5 cm².
