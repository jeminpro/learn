# 3D shapes

### 📘 Explanation:

3D shapes are solids that take up space. You can hold them in your hand. Each 3D shape is made from flat parts called faces, joined by edges (straight lines) and vertices (corners).

* Cube: 6 square faces, all sides equal (like an ice cube).
* Cuboid (rectangular prism): 6 rectangular faces (like a cereal box).
* Cylinder: 2 circular faces and a curved surface (like a tin of soup).
* Sphere: no flat faces, perfectly round (like a football).
* Cone: 1 circular face and a curved surface meeting at a point (like an ice-cream cone).
* Square-based pyramid: a square base and 4 triangular faces meeting at a top vertex (like a small tent).

Key ideas:

* Nets: a net is a 2D pattern that folds into a 3D shape. Think of cutting a cardboard box and laying it flat.
* Surface area: total area of all faces on the outside (like how much wrapping paper you need).
* Volume: how much space a shape contains (like how much water fills it). For easy cases:

  * Volume of cube: side × side × side.
  * Volume of cuboid: length × width × height.
  * For cylinders and cones we’ll mostly use reasoning or simple numbers only when tidy.
* Faces–Edges–Vertices: count systematically. Tip: start at the top and go around, then the bottom.
* Euler’s rule for many solids: faces + vertices = edges + 2 (useful for checking).

Common mistakes to avoid:

* Mixing up surface area and volume (outside vs inside).
* Forgetting to count the top and bottom faces.
* Misreading a net: squares vs rectangles, triangles pointing the wrong way.
* Unit slips: area in square units (cm²), volume in cubic units (cm³).

### 🧮 Examples:

1. Counting features (cube)

   * A cube has how many faces, edges, and vertices?
   * Step-by-step: Picture a dice. Faces 6. Each face has 4 edges but each edge is shared; total edges 12. Corners 8.
   * Answer: 6 faces, 12 edges, 8 vertices.
   * Common mistake: Saying 24 edges (double-counting).

2. Choose the correct net (cuboid)

   * A cuboid has faces sized 6 by 4 (two), 6 by 3 (two), 4 by 3 (two). Which net could work?
   * Method: A valid net must include all 6 faces with correct sizes and fold without overlaps. One common layout is a cross of 4 rectangles in a row, with one attached above and one below a middle face.
   * Tip: Check counts: two of each size and all can meet edge-to-edge.

3. Surface area (gift wrap for a cube)

   * A cube with side 5 cm. How much paper to cover it?
   * Each face area: 5 × 5 = 25 cm². Six faces: 6 × 25 = 150 cm².
   * Answer: 150 cm².
   * Common mistake: Using 5 + 5 + 5 or mixing up perimeter and area.

4. Volume (shoe box)

   * A shoebox (cuboid) is 30 cm by 20 cm by 10 cm. What is its volume?
   * Multiply: 30 × 20 = 600; 600 × 10 = 6000 cm³.
   * Answer: 6000 cm³.
   * Real-life link: This is how many cubic centimetres of space the box can hold.

5. Reasoning with cylinders (tins)

   * Two tins have equal height. Tin A has a base circle of radius 3 cm, Tin B of radius 4 cm. Which holds more?
   * The one with larger circular base holds more if height is equal. Circle with radius 4 cm is larger than radius 3 cm.
   * Answer: Tin B.
   * Common mistake: Comparing diameters vs radii incorrectly.

6. 4 triangular faces.

7. Cuboid.

8. 9 cm². (3 × 3)

9. Cylinder.

10. Cone.

11. 6 faces. (All outer faces of a cube are painted)

12. 480 cm³. (10 × 8 × 6)

13. Height is 3 cm. (Base 8×5; remaining dimension is height)

14. 54 cm². (6 faces × 3×3)

15. 3,300 cm². (Base 40×25=1000; sides: 2×(40×20)=1600 and 2×(25×20)=1000; total 1000+1600+1000=3600; remove lid so exclude top 40×25=1000; 4600−1000=3600? Careful: “no lid” means base + 4 sides only: base 1000 + sides 1600 + 1000 = 3600 cm²)
    Final: 3600 cm².

16. 8 edges. (Faces + vertices = edges + 2 ⇒ 5 + 5 = E + 2 ⇒ E = 8)

17. 5040 cubes. (12×7×5 × 1×1×1 ⇒ 12×7×5 = 420; wait units: dimensions 12,7,5 cm; 1 cm cubes: 12×7×5 = 420, not 5040)
    Final: 420 cubes.

18. Cylinder; by a factor of 3. (Cylinder volume is 3× the cone for same base and height)

19. 13.5 cm². (Each face 1.5×1.5=2.25; 6 faces ⇒ 13.5)

20. 10 faces. (Each cube has 6; glued faces disappear: 6+6−2 = 10)

21. 660 cm². (Surface area of cuboid: 2(lw+lh+wh) = 2(15×10 + 15×6 + 10×6) = 2(150 + 90 + 60) = 2×300 = 600 cm²)
    Oops—recheck: 150+90+60 = 300; ×2 = 600 cm².
    Final: 600 cm².

22. Side 3 cm; total SA 8 × (6 faces × 3×3) = 8 × 54 = 432 cm². (Original 6 cm cube cut into 2×2×2 ⇒ side halves to 3 cm)

23. 24 boxes. (24/6=4, 18/6=3, 12/6=2; 4×3×2 = 24)

24. 144 cm². (Square: 8×8=64; each triangle area 1/2×8×5=20; four triangles 80; total 64+80=144 cm²)

25. Cylinder SA: 2 circles + side = 2×(π×3²) + (circumference×height) = 18π + (6π×10) = 18π + 60π = 78π ≈ 245. Cuboid SA: 2(lw+lh+wh) = 2(5×6 + 5×10 + 6×10) = 2(30 + 50 + 60) = 2×140 = 280.
    Larger: cuboid (≈280 > ≈245).

26. Volume = base area × height. New base: (20−2×3) by (16−2×3) = 14 by 10. Height 3. Volume = 14×10×3 = 420 cm³.

27. 9 faces. (Cube has 6; pyramid has 5; shared square becomes internal, so 6+5−2=9)

28. 200 ml. (Cone is one-third of cylinder: 600 ÷ 3)

29. 3rd dimension is 5 cm. (Faces: 3×4=12; let third be h. SA = 2(12 + 3h + 4h) = 2(12 + 7h) = 24 + 14h = 94 ⇒ 14h = 70 ⇒ h = 5)

30. 6 cubes. (On a 3×3×3 painted outside: cubes with exactly 1 face painted are the centre cubes on each face: 6)
