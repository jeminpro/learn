# Triangles

### 📘 Explanation:

A **triangle** is a 2D shape with **3 sides** and **3 angles**. Triangles are everywhere — from road signs to roofs and bridges — and are the **strongest shape** in construction because their sides lock firmly together.

#### 🔹 Types by Sides:

1. **Equilateral triangle** – all sides and angles equal (each angle = 60°).
   *Example: A slice of pizza cut into 3 equal parts.*
2. **Isosceles triangle** – 2 sides and 2 angles equal.
   *Example: A kite’s top half.*
3. **Scalene triangle** – all sides and angles different.
   *Example: A random triangular sign.*

#### 🔹 Types by Angles:

1. **Acute-angled** – all angles less than 90°.
2. **Right-angled** – one angle exactly 90°.
3. **Obtuse-angled** – one angle greater than 90°.

#### 🔹 Key Facts:

* The **sum of angles** in every triangle = **180°**.
* **Longest side** is always opposite the **largest angle**.
* A triangle with one 90° angle is a **right triangle**; Pythagoras’ theorem applies:
  *In a right triangle, (hypotenuse)² = (side1)² + (side2)².*
  (e.g., 3-4-5 triangle).
* **Perimeter** = sum of all sides.
* **Area** = ½ × base × height.
  (Height is perpendicular from the base to the opposite vertex.)

#### 🧭 Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Forgetting to use 180° when finding missing angles.
* Confusing height with slant side (height must be perpendicular).
* Mixing side types and angle types.
* Using wrong base/height pair for area.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Finding a missing angle**

   * A triangle has angles 70° and 50°.
     Missing angle = 180 − (70 + 50) = **60°**.
   * Common mistake: forgetting to subtract from 180°.

2. **Identifying the triangle**

   * A triangle with sides 5 cm, 5 cm, and 8 cm is **isosceles** (two sides equal).
   * Common mistake: saying “scalene” without checking for equal sides.

3. **Area from base and height**

   * Base = 10 cm, height = 6 cm.
     Area = ½ × 10 × 6 = **30 cm²**.
   * Common mistake: multiplying directly (10×6) without halving.

4. **Perimeter problem**

   * Triangle sides are 7 cm, 9 cm, and 10 cm.
     Perimeter = 7 + 9 + 10 = **26 cm**.

5. **Right-angled triangle reasoning**

   * A triangle has sides 5, 12, and 13.
     Check: 5² + 12² = 25 + 144 = 169 = 13² → **right-angled triangle**.

### ✅ Answers:

1. 80°

2. Equilateral

3. 20 cm²

4. Right-angled triangle

5. Isosceles

6. 18 cm

7. 12 cm²

8. Scalene

9. Isosceles acute-angled

10. Acute-angled triangle

11. 80°, acute-angled

12. Height = 6 cm; area = ½×12×6 = 36 cm²

13. 10 cm

14. Isosceles, obtuse-angled (because 14² > 9²+9²)

15. Yes, right-angled (6²+8²=10²)

16. Height = 10 cm; area = ½×15×10 = 75 cm²

17. Right-angled (30-60-90 triangle)

18. Perimeter = 10 + 13 + 13 = 36 cm

19. 6 cm (½×8×h=24 ⇒ h=6)

20. The largest angle is opposite the longest side (10 cm side).

21. Perimeter = 42 cm; scalene, acute-angled

22. 2+3+4 = 9 parts → 180 ÷ 9 = 20°; angles 40°, 60°, 80°

23. Hypotenuse = 15 cm (3-4-5 scale); area = 54 cm²

24. Let height = h, base = h+10 → ½×h×(h+10)=60 → h²+10h=120 → h²+10h−120=0 → h=10 (ignore negative) → base=20

25. Total ratio = 12 parts → 60 ÷ 12 = 5 → sides 15 cm, 20 cm, 25 cm

26. Opposite 9 cm side is smallest angle; opposite 7 cm side is smallest angle; largest opposite 9 cm. Use logic (largest side ⇒ largest angle ≈ 100°)

27. 65° each (since 65 + 65 + 50 = 180)
