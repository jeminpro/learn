# Quadrilaterals

### 📘 Explanation:

A **quadrilateral** is any **4-sided polygon**. The word comes from *quad* (four) and *latus* (side). You can think of them as **“four-cornered shapes”** — picture windows, kites, or road signs.

All quadrilaterals share these basic facts:

* **4 sides**, **4 angles**, and **2 diagonals** (lines joining opposite corners).
* The **sum of all interior angles = 360°**.
* They can be **regular** (all sides/angles equal) or **irregular**.

#### 🔹 Common Types of Quadrilaterals

| Type              | Properties                                                                      | Real-life example                  |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| **Square**        | 4 equal sides, 4 right angles, opposite sides parallel                          | Floor tiles                        |
| **Rectangle**     | Opposite sides equal, 4 right angles                                            | Door, book                         |
| **Parallelogram** | Opposite sides equal & parallel, opposite angles equal, no right angles usually | Slanted book stand                 |
| **Rhombus**       | 4 equal sides, opposite angles equal, no right angles necessarily               | Diamond shape on cards             |
| **Trapezium**     | One pair of opposite sides parallel                                             | Bridge support, table leg crossbar |
| **Kite**          | Two pairs of equal adjacent sides, one line of symmetry                         | Flying kite                        |

#### 🔹 Key Formulas:

* **Perimeter** = sum of all sides.
* **Area (by type)**:

  * Square: side × side
  * Rectangle: length × width
  * Parallelogram: base × height
  * Rhombus: ½ × diagonal₁ × diagonal₂
  * Trapezium: ½ × (sum of parallel sides) × height

#### 🧭 Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Mixing up parallelogram and trapezium (check if *both* pairs or *one* pair of sides are parallel).
* Confusing diagonals with sides.
* Using slanted side instead of perpendicular height for area.
* Forgetting to add *all four sides* for perimeter.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Finding a missing angle**

   * A quadrilateral has angles 90°, 85°, and 110°.
     Missing angle = 360 − (90 + 85 + 110) = **75°**.
   * Common mistake: subtracting from 180° instead of 360°.

2. **Area of a rectangle**

   * Length = 12 cm, width = 5 cm → Area = 12 × 5 = **60 cm²**.
   * Tip: Both pairs of sides are parallel and equal.

3. **Perimeter of a square**

   * Side = 7 cm → Perimeter = 4 × 7 = **28 cm**.

4. **Area of a parallelogram**

   * Base = 10 cm, height = 6 cm → Area = 10 × 6 = **60 cm²**.
   * Remember: use height, *not* slanted side.

5. **Area of a trapezium**

   * Parallel sides = 8 cm and 4 cm, height = 5 cm.
     Area = ½ × (8 + 4) × 5 = ½ × 12 × 5 = **30 cm²**.
