# Position

### 📘 Explanation:

**Position** in geometry tells us **where something is located** — often on a grid, map, or coordinate plane. It’s all about **describing location and movement** using numbers and directions.

We usually use a **coordinate grid** (also called a Cartesian plane) with two axes:

* **x-axis (horizontal)** – goes left ↔ right
* **y-axis (vertical)** – goes up ↑ and down ↓
* The point where they meet is called the **origin (0,0)**

A point’s position is written as **(x, y)** → *(x first, then y)*
👉 Think **“along the corridor, then up the stairs.”**

#### 🔹 Example of Coordinates

| Point | Coordinates | Explanation           |
| ----- | ----------- | --------------------- |
| A     | (3, 2)      | Move 3 right, 2 up    |
| B     | (–2, 4)     | Move 2 left, 4 up     |
| C     | (0, 5)      | On y-axis             |
| D     | (–3, 0)     | On x-axis (left side) |

The **x-coordinate** can be **positive (right)** or **negative (left)**.
The **y-coordinate** can be **positive (up)** or **negative (down)**.

#### 🔹 The Four Quadrants

When both x and y can be positive or negative, the plane divides into **4 quadrants**:

| Quadrant | Sign of Coordinates | Example  |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------- |
| I        | (+, +)              | (3, 4)   |
| II       | (–, +)              | (–2, 5)  |
| III      | (–, –)              | (–3, –4) |
| IV       | (+, –)              | (4, –3)  |

#### 🔹 Distance & Midpoint (basic reasoning)

* **Horizontal or vertical distance** between two points:
  → Subtract x or y values (whichever changes).
  Example: (2, 5) and (7, 5) → distance = 7 – 2 = 5 units.
* **Midpoint** between two points:
  → Average of x’s and average of y’s.
  Example: between (2, 4) and (6, 8) → midpoint = ((2+6)/2, (4+8)/2) = (4, 6).

#### 🧭 Common Mistakes to Avoid:

* Writing coordinates backwards (always **x first, y second**).
* Confusing positive and negative directions.
* Counting squares diagonally instead of along axes.
* Forgetting to label the origin correctly.

### 🧮 Examples:

1. **Reading a coordinate**

   * Point P(4, 3): move 4 right and 3 up.

2. **Finding a missing coordinate**

   * Point A(2, 5), B(2, –1): same x, different y → vertical line.

3. **Midpoint example**

   * Between (1, 3) and (5, 3):
     Midpoint = ((1+5)/2, (3+3)/2) = (3, 3).

4. **Distance example**

   * Between (–2, 4) and (4, 4):
     Distance = 4 – (–2) = 6 units.

5. **Identifying quadrant**

   * Point (–3, –2) is in Quadrant III (both negative).
