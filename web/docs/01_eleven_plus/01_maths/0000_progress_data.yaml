          Now he got a bit better in forming expressions, needs more practice.

          He forgets to simplifying the problem need to revise on x+x = 2x, 2(x+5), x*x etc

          Revise some medium and hard questions again (13, 14, 21, 22, 24, 25?, 28).
          25/10/2025
          Problem understanding word problems like below
          - more than a number (doing times instead of addition)
          - 3 less than a number (writing 3-n instead of n-3)
          - Order of expression needs to improve (5 less than triple a number h-5x3 instead of 3h-5)
